Operating  
environment Challenges
External challenges have 
had varying levels of impact 
on our business throughout 
FY25. We have responded 
to these challenges and 
improved our performance 
y‑o‑y. Our commitment to our 
Reimagine strategy continues 
as we transition to becoming 
proud creators of the world’s 
most desirable luxury brands 
for the most discerning clients.  Supply constraints 
The automotive industry is often 
impacted by supply constraints, 
and whilst the easing of the supply 
constraints from prior years continued, 
our production volumes in the second 
quarter of the year were impacted by 
a temporary supply disruption. 
During the summer of 2024 a Tier 
1 supplier of high‑grade aluminium 
to the automotive sector suffered 
flooding at its plant in Switzerland. 
As a result, there was a short‑term 
impact on our production and 
consequently operating volumes in Q2; 
however, we recovered strongly in H2, 
with minimal impact on our production 
schedules and clients’ orders. 
Rising costs 
In recent years, our marketing costs 
have been lower than historical 
levels due to the business being 
supply‑constrained. Our rich mix of 
Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, 
and Defender has enjoyed strong 
demand throughout the year with 
minimal levels of variable marketing 
expense, although we are now seeing 
an increase in these costs across our 
product portfolio. We will continue 
to maintain a demand‑led model, 
but fixed marketing investment 
and variable marketing expenses 
are expected to continue to rise in 
response to tougher market conditions. 
China market conditions
The China market continued to face 
headwinds throughout the year, as 
our locally produced cars operate in 
a highly competitive environment, 
and retailer insolvencies and credit 
availability impacted volumes. 
We continue to offer retailer support 
and focus on marketing and sales 
efforts through model mix optimisation 
to improve retailer profitability. At the 
start of the year we announced the 
news that the Freelander brand will 
create complementary growth in China 
through a licensing agreement with our 
joint venture partner, Chery. 
Geopolitical 
Geopolitical challenges, including 
increasing geopolitical tensions and 
regulatory and legislative changes, 
have global reach and can impact 
supply chains. While we have not 
observed any direct impacts on our 
business in the last year as a result of 
specific events, we proactively scenario 
plan against a range of outcomes 
to ensure we’re able to effectively 
respond as a business. In addition, we 
are closely monitoring trade measures 
of the new administration in the US 
and evaluating the impact of the global 
tariff environments.’
