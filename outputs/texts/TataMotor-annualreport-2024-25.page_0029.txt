Changing customer 
requirement – Movement 
to higher tonnage
Fleet operators increasingly opted 
for higher tonnage trucks to improve 
operational efficiency and reduce 
cost per tonne‑kilometre. This 
shift was driven by rising freight 
volumes, logistics consolidation, and 
the expansion of hub‑and‑spoke 
distribution models. OEMs responded 
by fortifying their heavy‑duty portfolio, 
focusing on fuel efficiency, durability, 
and total cost of ownership to meet the 
evolving needs of large fleet operators.
Rising demand for 
alternate fuel buses
FY25 saw a surge in demand for 
alternate fuel buses, particularly 
electric, CNG, and LNG variants. 
Urban transport bodies and state 
undertakings prioritised cleaner 
mobility solutions, supported 
by government subsidies and 
environmental mandates. This shift 
accelerated the transition toward 
sustainable public transportation, 
prompting OEMs to invest in alternate 
fuel technologies and expand their 
green mobility offerings across city and 
intercity segments.
Government push for 
electrification in commercial 
vehicles
While infrastructure spending was 
relatively limited in FY25 due to fiscal 
constraints and election‑related 
priorities, the government intensified 
its focus on electrification in the 
commercial vehicle sector. Incentives 
under the PM e‑Drive scheme and 
various state EV policies supported 
the adoption of electric buses, 
three‑wheelers, and light commercial 
vehicles. This shift aligned with national 
sustainability goals and emission 
reduction targets, encouraging OEMs 
to accelerate investments in electric 
mobility solutions and expand their 
zero‑emission product portfolios.
