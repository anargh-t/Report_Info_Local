Other  income  includes  export  and  other  recurring  and  non-recurring  incentives  from  Government  (referred  as 
“incentives”). 
Government  grants  are  recognised  when  there  is  reasonable  assurance  that  the  Company  will  comply  with  the 
relevant conditions and the grant will be received.
Government grants are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when 
the Company recognizes, as expenses, the related costs that the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if 
the costs have already been incurred. Government grants related to assets are deferred and amortised over the useful 
life of the asset. Government grants related to income are presented as an offset against the related expenditure, 
and government grants that are awarded as incentives with no ongoing performance obligations to the Company are 
recognised as income in the period in which the grant is received.
