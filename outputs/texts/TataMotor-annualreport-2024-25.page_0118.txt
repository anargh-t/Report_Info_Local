Advancing safety standards 
towards achieving zero harm
Tata Motors remains steadfast in 
fostering a world‑class safety culture, 
prioritising the well‑being of our 
employees and stakeholders across all 
facets of operations. Our commitment 
was prominently reflected during the 
2023 Tata Group Workshop, where 
safety discussions with the Chairman 
took centre stage.
Throughout FY25, the Zero Incident 
Plan continued to be a cornerstone 
of our safety strategy, comprising 31 
focused themes and 51 major actions, 
each led by a senior leader to ensure 
sustained effectiveness.
A robust governance framework 
supports multi‑tier safety reviews:
•  The SHS Committee of the Board 
serves as the apex review body.
•  Monthly reviews are conducted 
by the SHE Councils and Apex 
Committees at each plant.
•  Dedicated safety assessments are 
also undertaken at defined intervals 
in non‑manufacturing functions, 
including Customer Service and 
Warehouse operations.
To reinforce our commitment to a 
strong safety culture, we engaged 
external experts DSS+ to conduct a 
rapid safety assessment across select 
plants. This initiative helped us identify 
actionable gaps and strengthen our 
overall approach to safety.
Our strategy was centred around 
proactive governance and building 
a Zero Harm Culture by reinforcing 
visible safety leadership behaviours 
across all levels of the organisation.
In Operations and Risk Management, 
our Critical to Safety (CTS) and 
Model Areas Initiative demonstrated 
exemplary leadership engagement, 
with strong adherence to safety 
protocols and behaviours. 
Systematic hazard identification and 
risk mitigation efforts at CTS stations 
led to a notable reduction in injuries. 
Initiatives like Drive Zero focused 
on high‑risk areas such as defensive 
driving and pre‑use safety checks.
(SDT) achievements and risk 
perception training reinforced 
capability‑building and 
frontline ownership.
On the digital front, we continued 
advancing the use of AI and video 
analytics‑based applications for 
predictive safety insights. Our long‑
term Business Partner Strategy 
includes integrated Business Partner 
(Contractor) Safety Management, 
ensuring clear accountability and 
optimal utilisation of safety resources.
Engagement with business partners 
remained a critical focus area. 
Targeted initiatives like Contractor 
Employee Safety Drives addressed 
high‑risk categories, while structured 
engagements improved safety 
ownership and visibility.
Under the People and Performance 
theme, we continued to empower 
our workforce through structured 
training programmes, leadership 
communication, and recognition 
initiatives. Self‑Directed Team 
Despite our ongoing efforts, 
we regret to announce that there 
was one workplace‑related fatal 
incident during FY25. The incident 
was thoroughly investigated, and 
systemic corrective actions were 
implemented company‑wide to 
prevent recurrence.
Our TRCFR trend continues to 
reflect a significant long‑term 
improvement, declining from 1.39 
in FY21 to 0.47 in FY25 Actuals, 
representing a 29% improvement 
from 0.66 in FY24. Additionally, the 
Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate 
(LTIFR) for FY25 was 0.13, a 35% 
reduction compared to 0.20 in 
FY24. These results highlight Tata 
Motors’ continued commitment to 
strengthening safety standards and 
reducing workplace injuries.
