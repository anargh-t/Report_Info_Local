Circularity through re-use and 
re-furbish
TATA OK facilitates the buying, selling, 
and exchanging of used commercial 
vehicles across India, offering a digital 
platform integrated with Fleetverse. 
This integration allows dealers to list 
vehicles for sale, providing customers 
with a broad inventory of over 400 
options — the largest among all 
OEMs. The introduction of the ‘Park 
n Sell’ feature enables customers 
to display vehicles for sale while 
continuing to use them, enhancing 
asset utilisation.
A key aspect of TATA OK’s approach 
is its focus on refurbishment. The 
platform has enhanced refurbishment 
controls, combining dealership 
networks, Fleetverse integration, 
and visibility into refurbishment 
processes. This strategy not only 
extends the life of existing vehicles 
Waste management
Tata Motors is committed to 
sustainable waste management, 
implementing a comprehensive 
internal auditing process that 
categorises waste and its disposal 
routes. Automobile manufacturing 
operations generate wastes and scrap. 
Scrap has inherent material value and 
can be re‑recycled. Waste is regulated 
by law based on its characteristics and 
includes both hazardous and non‑
hazardous types.
Our operations continuously drive 
initiatives aimed at eliminating, 
minimising, and recycling waste in 
accordance with legal requirements 
and available opportunities with 
quantified targets cascaded to 
operational sites. These initiatives 
include material recovery through 
authorised recyclers, co‑processing 
hazardous waste as alternative fuel and 
raw material and recycling of metal and 
non‑metal scrap through authorised 
recyclers.
but also offers warranties, ensuring 
quality and reliability. In FY25, TATA 
OK recorded the sale of 37,768 used 
commercial vehicles, reflecting the 
platform’s significant role in promoting 
vehicle reuse.
TATA OK offers Digital Evaluations at 
customer’s convenience. The pricing 
grid support to dealers is helping build 
confidence and traction.
Tata OK ‑ enabling second life 
A significant part of our waste 
management programme includes 
employee training on circularity in 
waste management, identification 
of new technologies and methods to 
minimise waste and divert waste from 
landfills. These efforts are helping all 
Plants to achieve the ‘Zero Waste to 
Landfill’ target by 2030.
Our manufacturing facilities 
in Lucknow, Pantnagar and 
Dharwad were certified 
‘Zero Waste to Landfill’ by 
CII‑GBC.
