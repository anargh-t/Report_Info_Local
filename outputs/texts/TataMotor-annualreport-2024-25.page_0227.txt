Tata Motors conducts comprehensive assessments of all its plants and offices to ensure compliance with human rights 
standards. Internal teams rigorously evaluate each facility, supported by robust checks and controls designed to identify 
and rectify any violations. These assessments are part of the regular ongoing reviews conducted by the senior leadership 
team of the Company.
Child  Labour:  Our  commitment  to  eradicating  child  labor  is  reflected  in  our  robust  systems  and  controls.  We  have 
implemented stringent measures to ensure that individuals under the age of 18 are not employed within our organization. 
Our  manpower  system  prohibits  the  onboarding  of  anyone  below  this  age  threshold,  while  our  rigorous  gate  control 
procedures guarantee that individuals under 18 are not granted access to our premises.
Forced/Involuntary Labour: We uphold the dignity and rights of all our employees by strictly prohibiting any form of forced 
or involuntary labor. To reinforce this commitment, we ensure that all employee salaries are deposited directly into their 
bank accounts, eliminating any possibility of coercion or exploitation in the payment process. This practice underscores our 
zero-tolerance stance against forced labor in any aspect of our operations.
Sexual  Harassment:  The  Company  maintains  a  steadfast  stance  of  zero  tolerance  towards  sexual  harassment  in  the 
workplace. In compliance with the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) 
Act,  2013,  and  its  accompanying  regulations,  we  have  established  a  comprehensive  Policy  on  Prevention,  Prohibition, 
and Redressal of Sexual Harassment. This policy is enforced across all our worksites and offices, and Internal Complaints 
Committees (ICCs) have been established to promptly and effectively address any complaints related to sexual harassment.
Discrimination at Workplace: We are committed to fostering an inclusive and equitable work environment where every 
individual is treated with dignity and respect. The Company strictly adheres to a non-discrimination policy, ensuring that 
all employees are valued for their skills, contributions, and potential—regardless of factors such as gender, race, religion, 
or nationality.
Wages:  We  recognize  the  importance  of  fair  and  equitable  compensation  for  our  employees.  Our  wage  practices  are 
informed by thorough market studies and are designed to comply with all relevant statutory regulations. By ensuring that 
our  employees  receive  wages  that  are  commensurate  with  industry  standards  and  legal  requirements,  we  uphold  our 
commitment to providing fair and just compensation for their hard work and dedication.
