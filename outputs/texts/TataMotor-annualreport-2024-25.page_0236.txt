Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP has 
provided limited assurance on data reported under this 
indicator.
1 Spend based method
2 This includes coverage of only the employee commute though company buses contracted by third parties at each plant location.
3 The leased assets are shared offices by TML CV business, TMPV and TPEM. The utility expenses are shared between the entities.
4 The calculation methodology involves data collected on Scope 1 and Scope 2 data from 342 dealer partners and extrapolation of the average 
emissions for each outlet category across total Commercial vehicle network.
* Category 1 numbers for FY24 have been restated due to change in methodology to apply the latest available emission factor database and 
adjustment of spent on products and services for PPP and inflation.

Tertiary Treatment of Wastewater 
at Pune and Jamshedpur Township
At the Pune-Pimpri Plant, wastewater generated from the 
process, along with treated sewage from PCMC, is treated 
together  using  membrane-based  technology  for  tertiary 
treatment.  The  treated  wastewater  from  this  process  is 
then  utilized  to  meet  both  the  plant’s  total  process  and 
non-potable water requirements.
At  the 
Jamshedpur  Plant,  the  township’s  sewage, 
amounting to approximately 1.6 MLD, is treated by a newly 
constructed  decentralized  STP  employing  Sequencing 
Batch Reactors (SBR) technology, followed by membrane-
based tertiary treatment.
At  both  the  Pune  and  Jamshedpur 
plants,  approximately  1  MLD  of 
freshwater  at  each  facility  will  be 
sewage.

neutrality.
