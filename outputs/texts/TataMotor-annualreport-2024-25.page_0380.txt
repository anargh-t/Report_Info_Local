Inflation risk
Some of the Company’s pension obligations are linked to inflation, and higher inflation will lead to higher liabilities 
(although,  in  most  cases,  caps  on  the  level  of  inflationary  increases  are  in  place  to  protect  the  plan  against  high 
inflation). The plans hold a significant proportion of assets in index linked gilts, together with other inflation hedging 
instruments and also assets which are more closely correlated with inflation. However an increase in inflation will also 
increase the deficit to some degree.
Life expectancy
The majority of the plan’s obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy 
will result in an increase in the plan’s liabilities. This is particularly significant in the UK defined benefit plans, where 
inflationary increases result in higher sensitivity to changes in life expectancy.
