Governance
Code of conduct 
Tata Motors has adopted the ethos 
from the legacy of the Tata Group’s 
core values of ethics, transparency, 
integrity, and responsibility, which are 
embedded into our systems through 
the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC). 
The TCoC represents the values and 
core principles guiding every aspect 
of our business. It lays down ethical 
standards for all their stakeholders viz. 
employees, customers, communities, 
business associates thereby ensuring 
alignment with best practices and 
international standards. We have 
established robust mechanisms for 
reporting non‑compliances, ensuring 
transparency and accountability.
