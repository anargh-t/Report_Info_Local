Engage  
for good
Our ambition is to 
become a benchmark 
for positive societal and 
community impact, 
to take care of the 
communities and 
environments in which 
we operate and to 
make a positive impact 
focusing on youth 
futures as well as the 
most vulnerable and 
disadvantaged.
Volunteering
Driven by our purpose to ‘Live The Exceptional With Soul’, colleagues have 
continued to drive change this year through our volunteering programme. 
Colleagues across the UK and Ireland are empowered to use their 16 hours of 
volunteering time, their skills and passion to support a wide range of causes that 
they care about, as well as causes that support our three key focus areas.
In 2024, JLR colleagues achieved a remarkable 34,547 hours of voluntary support, 
benefitting a wide range of worthwhile organisations in our local communities, 
including STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) 
Ambassadors, The Red Cross, Chapter One, Scouts and Girl Guide groups, food 
banks, schools, community groups, homeless shelters, hospices, animal shelters, 
and nature reserves. Over 9,000 of these volunteer hours have been contributed 
by over 1,150 STEM Ambassadors who use their volunteering time to inspire the 
next generation to consider careers in STEM.
Partnerships
British Red Cross and the International Federation of the Red 
Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC)
2024 marked 70 years of Defender’s landmark charity partnership with the 
Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. The relationship began in 1954, with 
the loan of a Series 1 Land Rover to act as a mobile dispensary in the Dubai 
desert. Since then, Defender has helped vulnerable communities to prepare for, 
respond to and recover from crises in over 50 countries, impacting the lives of 
over two million people. Defender continues its legacy and invests in flagship 
humanitarian projects that help communities build strength and resilience to 
the unpredictable.
