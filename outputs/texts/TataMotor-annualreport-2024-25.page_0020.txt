Domestic  
demand scenario
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
has projected India’s GDP growth at 
6.2% for 2025. This forecast reflects 
India’s strong economic fundamentals 
and resilience amid global economic 
challenges. On the infrastructure front, 
India has significantly ramped up its 
spending with increased Union budget 
allocation. For the fiscal year  
2025‑26, the Indian government has 
set a capital expenditure (capex) target 
of I11.21 lakh crore, marking a  
10.08% increase from the previous 
year’s revised estimate.
The Indian commercial vehicle 
industry is expected to maintain its 
growth trajectory in FY26, supported 
by continued positive momentum in 
the Indian economy despite global 
headwinds. However, commodity 
inflation may add cost pressures due 
to safeguarding duties and rising 
global demand.
The Indian passenger vehicle 
market is expected to sustain in the 
year with overall demand growth 
being shaped by macroeconomic 
factors such as consumption growth, 
inflation, infrastructure spending and 
global geopolitics.
