The  Company’s  policy  is  driven  by  considerations  of  maximising  returns  while  ensuring  credit  quality  of  the 
debt instruments. The asset allocation for plan assets is determined based on  investment criteria prescribed 
under the Indian Income Tax Act, 1961, and is also subject to other exposure limitations. The Company evaluates 
the  risks,  transaction  costs  and  liquidity  for    potential  investments.  To  measure  plan  asset  performance,  the 
Company compares actual returns for each asset category with published bench marks.
The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation as at March 31, 2025 is 10.14 years (March 31, 
2024 : 9.74 years).
The Company expects to contribute ₹11 crores to the funded pension plans in the year ending March 31, 2026.
