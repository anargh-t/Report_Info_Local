1   Carbon net zero
Our decarbonisation is underpinned by our ambition to be carbon net zero by 2039, 
through the decarbonisation of our manufacturing and operations, our supply chain 
and our vehicles in use.
GHG emissions reduction
•  our own operations
•  our supply chain
•  our vehicles in use

NET ZERO 
Operational emissions scope 1 and 2
Our operational emissions primarily consist of three elements:
1. 
2. 
3. 
 Scope 1 emissions from the combustion of gas on our sites for heat and energy
 Emissions generated from company‑owned vehicles
 Scope 2 emissions from electrical energy generation
Therefore, to decarbonise our operations to net zero, we must:
•  Reduce our energy consumption by driving greater efficiency and awareness at 
our sites
•  Use on‑site and off‑site renewable energy to decarbonise Scope 2 emissions
•  Reduce gas consumption and combustion at our sites through electrification

Key initiatives
We continued to implement energy‑
saving initiatives in FY25 with particular 
focus on paint shop optimisation and 
lighting as well as the installation of 
renewable energy sources. These 
projects prioritise two of our strategic 
focus areas:
•  To reduce our energy consumption
•  To utilise on‑site renewable energy
Key projects
•  The optimisation of the sealer oven 
and the installation of an eco‑smart 
Variable Exhaust Controller (VEC) 
primer oven within the Nitra, 
Slovakia paint shop.
•  LED and smart lighting upgrades at 
our Solihull and Halewood plants in 
the UK and our Electric Propulsion 
Manufacturing Centre (EPMC) in 
Wolverhampton, UK.
•  The installation of an intelligent 
compressed air system at our 
joint venture manufacturing site 
in China.
•  The installation of 18MW of 
ground‑mounted solar panels 
at our Gaydon, UK site, with 
generation expected to start in 
July 2025.
