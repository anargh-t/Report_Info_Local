21  Assets classified as held-for-sale
Assets are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered primarily through sale rather than through 
continuing use, if the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition and if the sale is highly probable. 
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are measured in accordance with the company’s accounting 
policies. Once classified as held for sale, the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. Any write-downs on initial classification or subsequent remeasurement are recognised in the consolidated 
statement of profit and loss.

22   Income taxes
(A)  Accounting policy
Income  tax  expense  comprises  current  and  deferred  taxes.  Income  tax  expense  is  recognised  in  the  consolidated 
statement of profit and loss except when they relate to items that are recognised outside of profit or loss (whether in 
other comprehensive income or directly in equity), in which case tax is also recognised outside profit or loss, or where 
they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case of a business combination the tax effect 
is included in the accounting for the business combination. Current income taxes are determined based on respective 
taxable income of each taxable entity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between 
the carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and unutilised business loss and depreciation 
carry-forwards and tax credits. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed separately for each taxable entity 
and for each taxable jurisdiction. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent it is probable that future taxable 
income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, unused tax losses, depreciation carry 
forwards and unused tax credits could be utilised. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each 
reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available 
to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
