Government Grants and Incentives
Other  income  includes  export  and  other  recurring  and  non-recurring  incentives  from  Government  (referred  as 
“incentives”). Government grants are recognised when there is a reasonable assurance that the Company will comply 
with  the  relevant  conditions  and  the  grant  will  be  received.  Government  grants  are  recognised  in  the  statement 
of profit and loss, either on a systematic basis when the Company recognises, as expenses, the related costs that 
the grants are intended to compensate or, immediately if the costs have already been incurred. Government grants 
related to assets are deferred and amortised over the useful life of the asset. Government grants related to income 
are presented as an offset against the related expenditure, and government grants that are awarded as incentives 
with no ongoing performance obligations to the Company are recognised as income in the period in which the grant 
is received.
