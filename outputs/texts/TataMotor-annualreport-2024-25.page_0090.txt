Eliminating use of hazardous and toxic 
chemicals at the product design stage 
through –
•  Paint elimination from 
polymeric parts
•  Restricted use of Persistent 
Organic Pollutants (POP’s) as per 
BRS convention
•  Proactive compliance with AIS‑129 
standard to restrict heavy metal 
usage (Lead, Mercury, Cadmium, 
Hexavalent Chromium) in vehicle 
below threshold limit
•  Elimination of flame retardants 
like TDCIPP, TCIP, TCEP in vehicle 
seat foam
Our initiatives
1
 Integrating innovative technologies 
such as nanotechnology, utilising 
natural fibre composites, repurposing 
pre‑consumer waste for textiles, 
promoting the recovery of precious 
materials, and extending the drainage 
period of oils
2
 Increasing the percentage of recycled 
input materials
3
Use of lifecycle impact assessments as 
a scientific tool to identify significant 
hot spots enabling corrective actions 
to be taken to reduce the product 
carbon footprint
