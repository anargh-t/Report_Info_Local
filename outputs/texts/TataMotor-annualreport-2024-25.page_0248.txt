In FY25, we launched new nameplate with the Tata Curvv 
and  Curvv.ev,  which  was  the  first  Indian  SUV  coupe  in 
the  mass  segment.  The  Tata  Curvv  combined  stylish 
design with performance, powered by a new Hyperion 
GDI  engine.  The  Curvv.ev  also  pushed  boundaries 
offering  real  range  of  more  than  400km,  while  also 
achieving  price  parity  with  ICE.  We  also  expanded  our 
twin-cylinder  CNG  portfolio  with  the  addition  of  the 
Nexon  iCNG,  which  is  India’s  first  turbocharged  CNG 
vehicle.  We  strengthened  the  Nexon.ev  with  a  45kWh 
battery pack offering more range to customers. We also 
refreshed  the  Tiago  with  the  Tiago  2025  intervention, 
with  reimagined  interiors  and  advanced  tech.  At  the 
Bharat  Mobility  Global  Expo  2025,  we  showcased  our 
recent  and  forthcoming  launches  including  the  Tata 
Sierra, Harrier.ev and Avinya X concept.
In the Utility Vehicles category, an increase of 11.4% from 
388,486 units in FY24 to 432,735 in FY25, represented a 
strong demand for Tata Nexon, Punch, Tata Harrier and 
SUV  Coupe.  This  also  reflects  customer  preference  of 
utility vehicles over hatchbacks.
The decrease in the Passenger Car category (Tata-brand 
vehicles in India) in FY25, represented demand of Tiago, 
Altroz and Tigor, including CNG variant and EV variant.

HCVs in India
Industry  has 
registered  a  year-on-year  decline. 
Our  volumes  dropped  by  8.6%  in  this  segment.  We 
introduced the Signa 5521.S with the 5L TATA Turbotronn 
engine  for  better  fuel  efficiency  in  return  empty  duty 
cycles,  alongside  a  range  of  alternate  fuel  vehicles  like 
the Prima 5530.S LNG and SIGNA 2820.T CNG. We also 
launched  the  Prima  4830.T  rigid  truck,  providing  high 
productivity with best-in-class features.
ILMCVs in India
Our  sales  in  the  ILMCVs  in  India  increased  by  5.7%. 
The  Intermediate,  Light,  and  Medium  Commercial 
Vehicle  (ILMCV)  segment  registered  robust  growth, 
driven by strong momentum in the MCV sub-segment, 
customer-centric initiatives, and enhanced key account 
management.  Strategic  product  introductions  like  the 
1416  LPK  and  1616  LPT  TRPCR  addressed  demand  for 
higher-rated  payloads  and  specialized  applications. 
We  further  expanded  the  portfolio  with  high-payload 
variants, including the 407 Gold+ and 710 LPT, catering 
to the evolving needs of our diverse customer base.
SCVs and Pickups in India
Volume is down by 12.7%, as we faced challenges arising 
from muted rural demand and tighter credit availability, 
which  impacted  retail  momentum.  We  solidified  our 
leadership  portfolio  with  11  new  products,  including 
the Ace Bi-Fuel and the Ace EV 1000, offering enhanced 
payloads  and  improved  efficiency.  The  Intra  V70  LNT, 
along  with  the  Intra  Gold  Series,  further  strengthened 
our  value  proposition  with  higher  load  capacities  and 
faster turnaround times.
CV Passenger Vehicles in India
Our sales in the CV passenger vehicles in India increased 
by 16.2%. The business saw the launch of the Magic Petrol, 
a bi-fuel (Petrol+CNG) variant, making it an industry-first 
in  the  minivan  segment,  catering  to  urban  school  and 
route applications with improved performance for FY25 
flexibility and operating economics. We also introduced 
a  new  MCV  platform  for  State  Transport  Undertakings 
(STUs), powered by a 5.6L Cummins engine for optimized 
fuel  efficiency  and  reliability  in  Mofussil  applications. 
Additionally, we launched a 9m electric school bus with 
a  10-year  battery  life,  reinforcing  our  commitment  to 
sustainable mobility. In the intercity bus category, 13.5m 
and  12m  chassis  equipped  with  EMR  were  introduced 
for enhanced braking and safety.
