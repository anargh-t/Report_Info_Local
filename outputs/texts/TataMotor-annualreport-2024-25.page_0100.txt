DEIsha Lighthouse Framework 
We launched the DEIsha Lighthouse Framework as our standard operating model 
to systematically address and measure progress in diversity, equity, and inclusion. 
The framework provides a comprehensive approach to ensure localisation, 
accountability and continuous improvement while creating a standard framework 
for reportage. 
The DEIsha Lighthouse Framework acts as both a  
strategic tool and a measurement system, ensuring that  
each of these DEI pillars is continuously improved upon for 
longâ€‘term success.
