Tata Affirmative Action 
Programme (TAAP)
The Tata Affirmative Action Programme (TAAP) refers to initiatives 
by Tata Companies in India for greater inclusion of disadvantaged 
sections of society. TAAP focuses on groups which have been 
socially and economically disadvantaged due to historical reasons/ 
displacement. Their access to opportunities, services and benefits 
in society are limited and therefore they are socially excluded. 
In TAAP, the current focus includes the Scheduled Castes, 
Scheduled Tribes, Persons with Disabilities and women from 
marginalised communities. As the name suggests, Affirmative 
action (AA) is an enabler to address the inherent disadvantage an 
AA community faces. The pursuit of Affirmative actions is to create 
equality of opportunity through creating access for disadvantaged 
(AA) communities.
In 2007 in the Tata Group established the Tata Group Forum 
on Affirmative Action. This was aligned with the CII taskforce 
on Affirmative Action which continues till today which 
recommended the industry to take systematic and time‑bound 
initiatives to enable SC/ST youth to realise their potential. 
Beginning 2010 onwards, TAAP Assessment process was started 
on the lines of the Tata Business Excellence Model (TBEM). 
The objective of the external assessments was to further 
embed AA in Tata companies and hold up best practices for 
emulation. This was named the TAAP‑ Tata Affirmative 
Action Programme Assessment.
The Tata Group AA policy was updated in  
2020 with an emphasis on Equal opportunity,  
Equity and Inclusion.
