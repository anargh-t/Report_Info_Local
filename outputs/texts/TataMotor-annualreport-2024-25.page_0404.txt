The Company is exposed to commodity price risk arising from the purchase of certain raw materials such as 
aluminium, copper, platinum and palladium. This risk is mitigated through the use of derivative contracts and 
fixed-price contracts with suppliers. On January 1, 2025, JLR applied hedge accounting to the existing trade 
book of aluminium and copper derivative contracts. Hedge accounting is also applied to new aluminium and 
copper contracts from the same date. The remaining derivative contracts are not hedge accounted under 
Ind AS 109 but are instead measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The  fair  value  (gain)/loss  on  non-hedge  accounted  commodity  derivative  contracts,  recognized  in  the 
consolidated statement of Profit and Loss was ₹ (162) crores and ₹ 1,531 crores for the years ended March 31, 
2025 and 2024, respectively.
A 10% appreciation/depreciation in all commodity prices underlying such commodity contracts that are 
sensitive  to  changes  in  commodity  prices  would  have  resulted  in  the  approximate  additional  (loss)/gain 
shown the in the table below:
