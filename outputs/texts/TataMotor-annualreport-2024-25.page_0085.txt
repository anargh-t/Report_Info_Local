Driving GHG emission reduction
In our pursuit of a more sustainable tomorrow, TML has outlined a strategic pathway to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions across Scope 1, 2, and 3. This roadmap reflects our deep commitment to climate action and long‑term 
environmental responsibility.
Our emissions reduction strategy
Scope 1&2
Scope 3
Achieve RE100 in operations by 2030
Optimise energy consumption 
Reduce and neutralise tailpipe 
emissions by shifting to low-emission 
vehicles and clean mobility
Convert equipment using fossil fuels 
to operate with renewable electricity
Adopt renewable electricity in our 
direct supply chain
Every product initiative across Tata Motors is seamlessly 
integrated with our decarbonisation agenda and Net Zero 
vision. Our future‑ready portfolio embraces a range of 
sustainable technologies, including Battery Electric Vehicles 
(BEVs), Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles and Hydrogen Internal 
Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicles.
Through these innovations, we’re reimagining mobility —
creating smarter, cleaner, and more responsible mobility 
solutions for the world.
