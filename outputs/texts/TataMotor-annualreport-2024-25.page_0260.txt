Liquidity and Capital Resources
We  finance  our  capital  expenditures  and  research  and 
development 
investments  through  cash  generated 
from  operations,  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  and  debt 
and  equity  funding.  We  also  raise  funds  through  the 
sale of investments, including divestments in stakes of 
subsidiaries on a selective basis.
The key element of the financing strategy is maintaining 
a  strong  financial  position  that  allows  us  to  fund  our 
capital  expenditures  and  research  and  development 
investments  efficiently  even  if  earnings  are  subject 
to  short-term  fluctuations.  Our  policies  for  liquidity 
and  capital  resources  are  appropriate  for  automotive 
operations and are set with business specific sensitivity 
analysis  and  by  benchmarking  our  competitors.  These 
are reviewed periodically by the Board.
(i)  Principal Sources of Funding Liquidity
Our  funding  requirements  are  met  through  a 
mix  of  equity,  convertible  or  non-convertible 
debt  securities  and  other  long  and  short-term 
limits 
borrowings  along  with  working  capital 
from  banks  and  financial  institutions.  We  raise 
funds  from  debt  markets  through  commercial 
paper  programs,  convertible  and  non-convertible 
instruments.  We 
debentures  and  other  debt 
regularly monitor funding options available in the 
debt  and  equity  capital  markets  with  a  view  to 
maintain financial flexibility.
