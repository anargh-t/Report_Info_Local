The above Aalingana targets are an integral  
part of the group’s sustainability strategy.  
In FY25, Tata Companies’ performance on Aalingana 
goals is as below:
On Preserving Nature & Biodiversity, 
nine companies have adopted a 
nature strategy, and 13 companies 
have invested in Nature‑based 
Solutions (NbS) projects.
On Driving Net Zero, the Group’s 
Scope 1+2 emissions have increased 
by 3% over the 2020 baseline, 
primarily driven through business 
growth and acquisitions. Over the 
years, an increasing number of 
companies have adopted a target of 
becoming Net Zero (including their 
Scope 3 emissions). As on date, 20 
Tata companies have a Net Zero 
target in alignment with Project 
Aalingana (except Air India, which 
has a target year of 2050).
On Pioneering Circular Economy, 
15 group companies have adopted 
the target to double renewable and/
or recycled resources. Additionally, 
in FY25, the group diverted 99.7% 
of its waste away from landfills 
through various resource recovery 
and gainful applications and 
replenished 47% of its annual 
freshwater withdrawal in the year 
(40% replenishment in the same 
river basin from where it was 
withdrawn).
