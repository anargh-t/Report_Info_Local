Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the 
past two to three years have revolutionised the technology 
landscape. Generative AI is emerging as a transformative 
force and is fundamentally different from the previous waves 
of technology disruption.
AI will have a transformative impact on every business, both 
B2C and B2B, in more ways than one. There is tremendous 
opportunity across our group companies to enhance 
customer experiences, reimagine manufacturing processes, 
innovate product design and engineering, and improve 
employee engagement with an AIâ€‘driven approach.
Recognising the critical role of data 
in scaling AI initiatives, we are driving 
data maturity across Group Companies 
through a comprehensive data excellence 
framework. Companies are setting up 
Centres of Excellence (CoEs) to identify and 
implement impactful AI projects and build 
tech talent.
Our investments in Cloud, Data and Digital provide a strong 
foundation for our AI journey. At Tata Group, we continue 
to strengthen partnerships with leading technology firms 
and research institutes to access the latest AI developments. 
Given the rapid pace of change in AI technologies, we 
continue to upskill our workforce and build vibrant 
communities for learning and sharing.
With the evolving threat landscape, cybersecurity remains 
a top priority. Tata Group companies are making significant 
investments in advanced cybersecurity technologies and 
workforce training to safeguard against evolving cyber risks.
