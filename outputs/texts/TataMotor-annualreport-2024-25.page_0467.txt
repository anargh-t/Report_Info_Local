27   Provisions
(a)   Accounting policy
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation 
that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the 
obligation. When the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the liability.
Product warranty expenses
The estimated liability for product warranties is recognised when products are sold or when new warranty programmes 
are initiated. These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost 
of  warranty  claims  and  management  estimates  regarding  possible  future  warranty  claims,  customer  goodwill  and 
recall complaints. The timing of outflows will vary depending on when warranty claim will arise, being typically up to 
six years. The Company also has back-to-back contractual arrangement with its suppliers in the event that a vehicle 
fault is proven to be a supplier’s fault.
The Company’s calculation methodology uses detailed historical data corrected for experience as information becomes 
available as well as individual campaign assumptions (such as scope, uptake rates and repair costs). The calculated 
provisions are compared to current spend rates to assess balances versus expected future obligations. This can lead 
to changes in the carrying value of provisions as assumptions are updated over the life of each warranty to reflect 
where actual experience differs to past experience, for example due to higher inflation or timing of claims impacting
