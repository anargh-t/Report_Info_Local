and  its  subsidiaries  together  referred  to  as  “the  Group”),

In  our  opinion  and  to  the  best  of  our  information  and 
according to the explanations given to us, and based on the 
consideration  of  reports  of  the  other  auditors  on  separate/
consolidated  financial  statements/financial 
information

operations  as  were  audited  by  the  other  auditors,  the 
aforesaid  consolidated  financial  statements  give 
the 
information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“Act”) in 
the manner so required and in the context of the overriding 
effect  of  the  provision  in  the  Scheme  of  arrangement  as 
approved  by  the  National  Company  Law  Tribunal  (‘NCLT’), 
regarding accounting of sale of discontinued operations from 
the specified retrospective appointed date give a true and fair 
view  in  conformity  with  the  accounting  principles  generally 
accepted in India, of the consolidated state of affairs of the 
Group,  its  associates,  joint  ventures  and  joint  operations 
as  at  31  March  2025,  of  its  consolidated  profit  and  other 
comprehensive income, consolidated changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flows for the year then ended.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with the Standards on 
Auditing (SAs) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our 
responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the 
Auditor’s  Responsibilities  for  the  Audit  of  the  Consolidated 
Financial  Statements  section  of  our  report.  We  are 
independent of the Group, its associates, joint ventures and 
joint operations in accordance with the ethical requirements 
that  are  relevant  to  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  in  terms  of  the  Code  of  Ethics  issued  by  the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant 
provisions of the Act, and we have fulfilled our other ethical 
responsibilities  in  accordance  with  these  requirements.  We 
believe  that  the  audit  evidence  obtained  by  us  along  with 
the  consideration  of  reports  of  the  other  auditors  referred 
to in paragraph (a) of the “Other Matters” section below, is 
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion 
on the consolidated financial statements.
Emphasis of Matter
We  draw  attention  to  Note  51  to  the  consolidated  financial 
statements  which  describes  the  overall  accounting  and 
the  basis  for  restatement  of  the  comparative  financial 
information for the year ended 31 March 2024 by the Holding 
Company’s  Management  consequent  to  the  Scheme  of 
arrangement  (‘Scheme’)  for  merger  of  Tata  Motors  Finance 
Limited  (a  step-down  subsidiary  of  the  Holding  Company) 
with  Tata  Capital  Limited.  The  Scheme  has  been  approved 
by the National Company Law Tribunal (‘NCLT’) vide its order 
dated 01 May 2025 with appointed date of 1 April 2024 and a 
certified copy has been filed by Tata Motors Finance Limited, 
with  the  Registrar  of  Companies,  Maharashtra,  on  08  May 
2025.  In accordance with the scheme approved by NCLT, the 
Holding  Company  has  given  effect  to  the  Scheme  from  the 
retrospective  appointed  date  specified  therein  i.e.  1  April 
2024 which overrides the relevant requirement of Ind AS 110 
(according to which the Scheme would have been accounted 
for  from  08  May  2025  which  is  the  date  of  loss  of  control 
as  per  the  aforesaid  standard).  The  financial  impact  of  the 
aforesaid treatment has been disclosed in the aforesaid note. 
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional 
judgment and based on the consideration of reports of other 
auditors  on  separate/consolidated  financial  statements  of 
components  audited  by  them,  were  of  most  significance  in 
our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  the 
current period. These matters were addressed in the context 
of  our  audit  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  as  a 
whole,  and  in  forming  our  opinion  thereon,  and  we  do  not 
provide a separate opinion on these matters.
