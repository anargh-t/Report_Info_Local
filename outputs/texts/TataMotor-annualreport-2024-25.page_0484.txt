Note:
(i) 
Tata  Motors  Limited  (the  “Company”)  in  October  2019  had  by  way  of  an  application,  addressed  to  the  Employee 
Provident Fund Organization (“EPFO”), offered to surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the Company 
incurred losses for three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic 
cancellation/ withdrawal of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that 
those who were members of a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their 
employer to contribute to their Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw a higher pension 
calculated based on last 5 years average salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its 
employees for joint option to contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal.
As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of ₹165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary 
during the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s 
Pension Trust. Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the conclusion of 
the surrender process of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon’ble Delhi High Court (“Court”) 
for seeking directions to EPFO to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund. The trade unions have also 
filed another Writ Petition for expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of 
the employees.
