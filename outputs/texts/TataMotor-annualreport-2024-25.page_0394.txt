Valuation  techniques  with  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial 
assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither 
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based 
on  available  market  data.  The  main  items  in  this  category  are  investments  in  certain  unquoted  debentures 
and equity.

Costs of certain unquoted equity instruments have been considered as an appropriate estimate of fair value 
because these investments are subject to a wide range of possible fair value measurements and cost represents 
the  best  estimate  of  fair  value  within  that  range.  These  investments  in  equity  instruments  are  not  held  for 
trading. Instead, they are held for medium or long-term strategic purpose. The Company has chosen to designate 
these  investments  in  equity  instruments  as  at  FVTOCI  as  the  management  believe  that  this  provides  a  more 
meaningful presentation for medium or long-term strategic investments, than reflecting changes in fair value in 
profit or loss.
Fair values of forward derivatives and commodity swap contracts are estimated by discounting expected future 
contractual  cash  flows  using  prevailing  market  interest  rate  curves.  Option  contracts  are  fair  valued  using 
standard options pricing methodology, based on prevailing market interest rates and volatility.
