Contractor Safety Program
Contractor safety is structured through corporate oversight. Business partners are categorized by risk, assessed via a 
Star Rating System and engaged through 169 self-managed teams.
Key focus areas for FY25
Focus on safe equipment maintenance, vehicle operations, utilities, housekeeping, and facility installations.
• 
Digital & AI Initiatives
AI-driven  analytics  and  PPE  monitoring  are  being  deployed,  focusing  on  connected  workforce,  assets,  video 
analytics, and skill development. Thirteen pilots are complete; full PPE monitoring is targeted by FY26.
• 
People and Recognition
Continuous learning (E-modules), multi-level recognition (Spot Awards, Safety Stewards), and quarterly rewards 
for contractors drive safety engagement. 244 trainers have been developed under the Train-the-Trainer initiative.
• 
Compliance and Continuous Improvement
Rigorous audits and proactive safety measures ensure compliance and accountability. Tata Motors is committed 
to a zero-harm future through continuous innovation and data-driven safety strategies.
b)  What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a routine and non-routine basis 
by the entity?
Tata Motors uses a structured, proactive risk assessment approach to identify and mitigate hazards across routine 
and non-routine activities. Through continuous monitoring, advanced analytics, and worker engagement, risks are 
prioritized based on likelihood and severity, ensuring effective control measures.
A.  Routine Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment
• 
Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment (HIRA):
Conducted bi-annually to assign a Risk Priority Number (RPN) based on severity, likelihood, and exposure, 
applying the Hierarchy of Controls (elimination prioritized). All assessments are digitally recorded for real-
time tracking and trend analysis.
• 
Continuous Safety Monitoring & Audits:
Safety  observations,  walkthroughs,  and  layered  audits  (factory,  department,  corporate)  ensure  control 
adherence. Performance is measured via the Proactive Safety Index (PSI), combining proactive and incident-
based metrics.
•  Worker Involvement:
Toolbox Talks and “TAKE 2” sessions engage workers in hazard assessment before tasks. Behavior-Based 
Safety (BBS) observations promote safe practices.
B.  Non-Routine Hazard Identification & Risk Assessment
• 
Job Safety Analysis (JSA):
Conducted before non-routine or high-risk tasks, providing step-by-step hazard controls.
• 
Permit-to-Work (PTW) System:
Mandatory  for  high-risk  activities  like  hot  work,  confined  space  entry,  electrical  maintenance,  work  at 
heights, excavation, and lifting, ensuring authorization and training compliance.
• 
Access Control & Work Area Safety:
Barricading and Lockout/Tag-out (LOTO) systems prevent unauthorized access and control hazardous energy.
• 
Advanced Risk Assessments:
Specialized assessments like HAZOP (process safety), QRA (risk quantification), and FMEA (failure prevention) 
are deployed for high-risk or complex operations.
