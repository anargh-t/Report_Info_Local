Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) 
At Tata Motors, safety is a core organisational value and a strategic business 
priority. Tata Motors implements a systematic and dynamic HIRA process to 
proactively identify, assess, and control workplace hazards. This approach is 
fundamental to driving a Zero Harm Culture and forms the backbone of our safety 
risk management framework.
All worker activities are mapped and assessed based on task complexity, incident 
history, and operational exposure. Risk Levels are categorised as Trivial, Tolerable, 
Moderate, Substantial, or Intolerable, and risk levels are determined using severity 
and likelihood matrices.

Red Corner Recommendations
Red Corner recommendation closure 
100%
All SIF (Serious Injury and Fatality) 
scenarios are tracked under 
structured Red and Blue Corner 
Recommendations, with 100% 
closure of Red Corner actions, 
ensuring complete risk elimination 
and cross‑functional deployment of 
corrective actions.
Technology-driven risk control
AI‑based video analytics and 
connected workforce systems were 
deployed in hazardous zones to detect 
unsafe conditions in real time and 
enhance preventive risk management.
The HIRA process is tightly integrated 
into safety governance and operational 
decision‑making, especially in high‑risk 
areas such as EV battery handling, 
Hydrogen fuel systems, and LNG 
operations — positioning Tata Motors 
as future‑ready and risk‑resilient.
