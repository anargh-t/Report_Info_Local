Risk management
Managing our environmental 
and social risks is integrated into 
the Company’s enterprise risk 
management process. We collaborate 
with multiple stakeholders across the 
organisation to identify and address 
the most significant environmental 
and social risks to our business, with 
appropriate escalation to the Risk and 
Compliance Committee.
Disclosure and reporting
Much of the emerging sustainability 
legislation requires greater levels 
of transparency and disclosure 
on business impacts, risks and 
opportunities in relation to 
environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) topics. This greater transparency 
is crucial to meet the needs and 
expectations of our stakeholders.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion is becoming an ever‑challenging topic 
globally; however, we believe that we must reflect the diversity of the 
world in which our colleagues and clients live. We are committed to our 
cultural transformation to create a positive, inclusive environment where 
everyone feels respected, valued and cared for.
To do this, we are taking action to make tangible impact, measured 
against three internal ambitions:
Target 1: 
 Globally, 30% of all senior leaders to be female, by 2030. 
FY25 performance: 21%
Target 2: 
 In the UK, 15% of all senior leaders to be from Black, Asian or Mixed 
Ethnicity background, by 2030.  
FY25 performance: 7%
Target 3: 
 Globally, for our Inclusion Index to reach over 85, by 2026.  
FY25 performance: 83
The target date to achieve ambitions 1 and 2 has been extended from 2026 to 2030. 
We recognise that we have more work to do and are allowing time to make further 
adjustments and for organic growth.
