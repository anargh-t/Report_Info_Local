3  Property, plant and equipment
(A)  Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or construction less accumulated depreciation and 
accumulated impairment, if any.
Freehold land is measured at cost and is not depreciated.
Heritage assets, comprising antique vehicles purchased by the Company, are not depreciated as they are considered 
to have a residual value in excess of cost. Residual values are re-assessed on an annual basis.
Cost includes purchase price, non-recoverable taxes and duties, labour cost and direct overheads for self-constructed 
assets and other direct costs incurred up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use.
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment is capitalised only when it is probable that future 
economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. 
Repairs and maintenance costs are recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss when incurred.
Interest cost incurred is capitalized up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets, based 
on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings, if no 
specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the Straight-Line Method (SLM) over the estimated useful lives of the assets considering 
the nature, estimated usage, operating conditions, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, 
manufacturerâ€™s warranties and maintenance support. Taking into account these factors, the Company and its domestic 
group companies have decided to retain the useful life hitherto adopted for various categories of property, plant and 
equipment, which are different from those prescribed in Schedule II of the Act.
