Dear Shareholders,
I hope this letter finds you in good 
health and spirits.
FY25 proved to be a year of resilience 
for the Indian passenger vehicle (PV) 
industry. After three consecutive years 
of strong growth, the sector entered 
a phase of consolidation, growing by a 
modest 2% with 4.3 million units sold. 
While demand for personal mobility 
remained steady, macroeconomic 
headwinds and a high base effect 
contributed to a moderation in overall 
industry growth.
This moderate growth was fuelled 
by the continued rising popularity of 
SUVs — which accounted for 55% of 
total sales and a rapidly increasing 
consumer preference toward 
environmentally friendly powertrains. 
Preference for emission‑friendly 
CNG vehicles surged by ~35%, and 
Electric vehicles gained renewed 
momentum, supported by a growing 
number of industry players expanding 
customer choices and reinforcing the 
EV ecosystem.
At Tata Motors, we navigated this 
evolving landscape with agility and 
determination while making steady 
progress on key strategic priorities, 
strengthening the foundation for 
sustainable, long‑term growth. Despite 
lower discretionary spending among 
consumers, our vehicles continued to 
attract strong interest, underpinned by 
a reputation for safety, innovation, and 
design. Our customer‑first approach 
enabled us to maintain leadership or 
strong positions across key segments.
In FY25, the Tata Motors PV and EV 
businesses registered wholesales of 
5,56,367 units, including 64,269 units 
of EVs with a revenue of I48,445 crore 
and an EBIT of 0.9%. Amidst a 
challenging environment, the business 
remained resilient, recording an 
EBITDA % improvement of 40 bps 
over FY24, enabled by holistic 
cost‑reduction initiatives and tight 
control over fixed costs.
In the EV segment, we became one 
of the few global manufacturers 
to achieve positive EBITDA, on the 
back of a higher level of localisation, 
aggressive cost reduction, and securing 
PLI benefits.
Driving market agility with 
innovation
In a year marked by fluctuating 
demand, our ‘demand pull strategy’ 
strongly focused on market 
responsiveness for deeper engagement 
with customers and channel partners. 
We actively used Vahan registration 
data as a near real‑time indicator of 
retail performance to track regional 
trends to fine‑tune both our supply and 
product mix as well as its availability.
We outpaced the overall SUV market 
with strategic launches and targeted 
product enhancements that resonated 
strongly with our customers. Across 
various segments of the industry, 
Tata Punch emerged as the top choice 
for private buyers and also ranked 
as India’s No. 1 SUV in FY25. During 
the year, we successfully launched 
India’s first SUV Coupe under the new
