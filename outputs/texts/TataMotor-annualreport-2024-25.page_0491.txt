ultimately recognised in profit or loss as the hedged item affects profit or loss (for example through cost of goods 
sold). For forecast transactions, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is 
retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is 
immediately transferred to the statement of Profit and Loss for the year.
