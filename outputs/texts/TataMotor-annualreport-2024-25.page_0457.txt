consumables  are  ascertained  on  a  moving  weighted  average  basis.  Cost,  including  fixed  and  variable  production 
overheads, are allocated to work-in-progress and finished goods determined on a full absorption cost basis. Cost of 
inventories also include all other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net
