Emergency Preparedness & Continuous Improvement
• 
Regular  emergency  drills  test  response  readiness  for  scenarios  like  fire,  chemical  spills,  and  gas  leaks. 
Incident  investigations  use  Root  Cause  Analysis  (RCA)  for  continual  safety  improvements.  AI-driven 
platforms enable real-time risk prediction and management.
Tata Motors’ data-driven, evolving safety framework integrates structured assessments, digital monitoring, 
and worker participation to sustain a zero-harm culture across all operations.
c)  Whether  you  have  processes  for  workers  to  report  the  work  related  hazards  and  to  remove  themselves  from 
such risks.
Yes, Tata Motors has robust and comprehensive processes in place for workers to report work-related hazards and 
to remove themselves from such risks.  We firmly believe that a safe and healthy workplace is not just a desirable 
outcome, but a fundamental right for every employee. Our commitment to this principle is reflected in the multi-
faceted approach we take to hazard reporting and risk mitigation. We empower our employees to be active participants 
in maintaining a safe work environment, providing them with the tools, training, and authority to identify, report, and, 
when necessary, immediately remove themselves from potential hazards. This commitment is not merely a policy on 
paper; it’s a deeply ingrained cultural value, reinforced through continuous training, open communication, and a clear 
understanding that safety is everyone’s responsibility.
1.  Multiple Reporting Mechanisms for Work-Related Hazards
• 
• 
• 
Digital Safety Reporting Platform: Employees can report hazards and near-misses in real-time through a 
dedicated digital system (Safety Portal) integrated into the company’s safety management framework.
Safety Observation (SO) Process: Workers identify and report unsafe acts, conditions, and near-misses for 
prompt corrective action.
Action Employee Can Take (AECT) Program: Encourages employees to take ownership of safety by flagging 
and mitigating hazards proactively.
•  Whistleblower  Mechanism  &  Open-Door  Policy:  Ensures  anonymous  reporting  and  protection  from 
retaliation, fostering a culture of transparency and trust.
• 
Self-Directed  Team  (SDT)  &  Self-managed  Team  (SMT)  Safety  Point  Leaders:  On-ground  shop  floor 
representatives of self-employees and Business partners lead hazard identification and reporting programs.
2.   Empowering Workers to Remove Themselves from Unsafe Conditions
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Stop  Work  Authority  (SWA):  Employees  have  the  right  to  immediately  stop  work  if  they  perceive  an 
imminent risk to health and safety.
Escalation Procedures: Workers can escalate unresolved safety concerns to safety officers, supervisors, or 
the site SHE team for immediate intervention.
Joint  Safety  Committees:  Employee  representatives  actively  participate  in  safety  governance,  risk 
assessments, and hazard control initiatives.
Incident Investigation & Corrective Actions: Every reported hazard undergoes root cause analysis (RCA) 
and triggers corrective and preventive actions with follow-up audits.
Regular Safety Training & Toolbox Talks: Employees receive continuous safety training on identifying risks, 
reporting hazards, and exercising their right to a safe work environment.
Through this comprehensive approach, Tata Motors fosters a safety-first culture where employees are actively 
involved in hazard identification, risk reporting, and workplace safety improvements.
d)  Do the employees / worker of the entity have access to non-occupational medical and healthcare services?
Tata Motors is committed to a safe, healthy, and sustainable workplace through a robust safety management system, 
risk  mitigation  strategies,  and  continuous  improvement.  Integrating  ISO  45001  standards,  digital  tools,  predictive 
analytics,  and  strong  governance,  the  company  promotes  a  zero-incident  culture  across  manufacturing,  research, 
supply chains, and business partner ecosystems.
