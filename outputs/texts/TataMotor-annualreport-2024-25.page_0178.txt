Data  driven  analytics  using  AIML/Gen  AI  play  a 
significant  role  in  enhancing  business  operations 
to the next level. Data analytics provide insights of 
what, where and when about failure/critical events 
to  focus  on  and  alerts  for  planning  corrective 
actions  in  advance.  Use  of  predictive  models  in 
various  aspects  of  product  development  and 
manufacturing is not only shortening cycle time but 
also reducing time to converge on early decisions.
