2    Circular economy and 
resource efficiency
The resources we use and consume play a pivotal role in the environmental impact 
of our supply chain, operations and products in use. Our pathway to net zero 
requires us to embrace the circular economy to help ensure that we reduce our 
impact whilst creating value and making our supply chain more resilient.
In FY25 we have started to put our circular economy strategy into action by 
delivering projects to decouple value creation from resource use and supporting 
our net zero ambition through our three mission statements:
Enablers
Resources
Products  
and services
We must create 
circular value 
through systemic 
collaboration, 
innovation 
and partnerships.
We must act as a 
responsible user 
of resources by 
maximising reuse, 
replenishment 
and recycling.
We must provide 
timeless luxury 
through enhanced 
product utility 
and longevity.
