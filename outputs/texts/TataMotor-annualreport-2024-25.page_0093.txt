Water management
Tata Motors acknowledges the 
significance of water as a shared 
and scarce resource. We are 
committed to sustainable water 
management, implementing a 
comprehensive internal auditing 
process that categorises water based 
on its withdrawal source — such 
as surface water, groundwater, 
or third‑party supplies — and its 
discharge destination. We recognise 
the importance of optimising water 
consumption through a judicious 
mix of water conservation, effluent 
re‑cycling and rainwater harvesting as 
per the prevailing conditions at each 
Plant location.
The Company has made significant 
strides in reducing water consumption 
leading to a 7% reduction in 
operational water withdrawal.

Our water management programme 
includes employee training on water 
management, identification of new 
technologies, monitoring methods 
and analysis to minimise water 
consumption and wastages. These 
efforts are helping all Plants to achieve 
the ‘Water Neutrality’ target by 2030.
