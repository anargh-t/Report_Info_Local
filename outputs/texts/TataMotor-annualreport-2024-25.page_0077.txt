9 Climate change
Description
Consequences
Mitigations and opportunities
We may incur significant reputational 
damage, which could materially impact 
our brands and sales, if we fail to maintain 
environmental compliance. Regulatory and 
governmental policy changes may introduce 
additional operational costs in the form of 
carbon pricing and taxation. Rising frequency 
of extreme weather events and global 
warming can directly and indirectly impact 
our supply chains and operations, potentially 
hindering our ability to meet demand.
Tata Motors acknowledges the short, medium 
and long‑term physical and transition risks 
associated with climate change. Our ambition 
to achieve net zero GHG emissions for our 
Passenger Vehicle (PV) and Commercial Vehicle 
(CV) businesses by 2040 and 2045 respectively 
will contribute to fulfilling India’s stated 
aspiration of achieving net zero GHG emissions 
by 2070. 
JLR is transforming its business with the aim 
to become carbon net zero across its supply 
chain, products and operations by 2039. We are 
proactive in meeting environmental regulations 
and compliance, seeing each regulatory change 
as an opportunity to enhance product value 
and meet stakeholder aspirations. 
Non‑compliance with laws and regulations 
may subject us to civil and/or criminal 
actions, resulting in damages, product recalls, 
regulatory measures, fines, and/ or criminal 
sanctions, all of which could negatively 
impact our corporate reputation.
We are dedicated to adhering to the laws 
and regulations in all countries where we 
conduct business. Our specialist teams 
diligently monitor legal and regulatory 
developments, establish detailed standards, 
and ensure awareness and compliance with 
these standards.
The transition away from traditional fossil 
fuels to renewable energy sources – and 
the increasing pace of that transition – 
creates particular compliance challenges, 
in particular tailpipe emissions for 
automotive companies and wider compliance 
requirements for carbon emissions produced 
during manufacturing and other operations. 
Climate change presents both acute and 
chronic physical risks to our operations and 
value chain.
It also poses transition risks to our business, 
including technological advancements in 
products and changes in the market and 
policy landscape.

safety, defective components, systems or 
general design defects, emissions and fuel 
economy, competition, alleged violations 
of law, labour, dealer, supplier and other
