the ‘Better Always’ brand refresh. 
In response to the ever‑changing 
customer expectations on agility, 
technology and partnership for 
greater success, we are refocusing 
all our actions to sharpen our Core 
Value Proposition. This new identity 
captures our core ethos  — agility and 
growth‑oriented mindset, pushing 
the limits with positivity and humility 
and an endeavour to deliver better 
in every moment to all stakeholders. 
It will be a cornerstone in building 
brand distinctiveness and customer 
resonance in the post‑demerger phase.
Accelerating innovation 
and sustainability
Innovation remains central to our 
purpose. This year, we proudly unveiled 
India’s first Hydrogen‑powered Internal 
Combustion Engine (H2ICE) truck — a 
significant milestone in our alternate 
fuel roadmap. We continue to invest in 
clean mobility across EVs, CNG, LNG, 
and hydrogen, ensuring our customers 
have access to a range of sustainable 
choices. We have invested ahead of 
time in various EV hardware aggregates 
as well as control software, which 
will enhance the performance and 
efficiency of our Electric vehicles being 
launched across the range during this 
year. Similarly, we are keenly exploring 
the opportunities in Software Defined 
Vehicles, including the enabling vehicle 
architecture and technology stack, 
with an aim to address India‑specific 
market and customer requirements.
Our Smart City Mobility portfolio has 
now deployed over 3,600 electric 
buses, covering 30+ crore km with 
>95% uptime. With Renewable 
Electricity (RE) now powering over 
45% of our CV Operations and Scope 3 
emissions down 12% year‑on‑year, we 
are well on track toward our Net Zero 
and RE100 goals.

Embracing the digital and 
AI opportunity
The digital foundations laid over the 
past years are now enabling us to 
adopt AI‑led transformations — both in 
customer‑facing solutions and internal 
operations. We are piloting AI‑driven 
predictive maintenance, real‑time fleet 
insights, intelligent CRM tools, and 
personalisation in sales journeys. These 
steps will help us offer differentiated 
value, sharpen our responsiveness, 
and elevate user experience.
We have also made good progress on 
Enterprise Digital, especially in the 
area of Industry 4.0 in manufacturing, 
digitalisation of the supply chain, 
and E‑Guru in sales. This has led 
to significant improvement in our 
delivery performance as well as 
overall efficiency.
Building a global business
Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles 
is an enterprise with strong global 
aspirations. Our products are already 
present in several markets, and we 
continue to build capabilities and forge 
alliances to strengthen the same — 
while staying attuned to geopolitical 
and tariff‑related challenges that may 
shape the near‑term trade landscape.
Empowering drivers, 
enhancing road safety
At the heart of our business lies the 
community of drivers, the unmarked 
soldiers who keep the wheels of 
our growing economy running. We 
continue to expand our outreach and 
support for drivers through training 
programmes, wellness initiatives, and 
digital tools that enhance safety and 
efficiency. Notable efforts include 
the deployment of ADAS (Advanced 
Driver Assistance Systems) features 
in key models and safety training 
modules integrated within our driver 
connect platforms. Our commitment 
to road safety is reflected in sustained 
partnerships with regulatory bodies 
and transport associations to drive 
behaviour change and awareness.
Developing talent, 
enabling growth
TMCV’s growth is underpinned by 
a culture of continuous learning 
and capability building. We have 
scaled multiple talent development 
programmes focused on future 
skills, leadership, diversity, and 
digital proficiency. Our investments 
in technical training centres and 
partnerships with academic institutions 
ensure that we are readying a future‑fit 
workforce aligned with industry shifts.
Looking ahead
The commercial vehicle industry is fast 
transforming toward cleaner, smarter, 
and more connected solutions, and 
Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles is 
well positioned to lead this evolution. 
While FY26 brings optimism with 
anticipated post‑election policy clarity 
and infrastructure momentum, the 
global economic landscape remains 
fluid. Geopolitical uncertainties and 
emerging trade barriers may impact 
global commerce and, in turn, our 
international aspirations. We remain 
vigilant and responsive to these 
dynamics, guided by a sharper, more 
agile organisation, a deeply integrated 
ecosystem, strong global ambitions, 
and an unwavering commitment to 
innovation. This foundation gives us 
the confidence to navigate near‑term 
challenges while unlocking sustainable, 
long‑term growth and value for 
all stakeholders.
Thank you for your continued trust 
and support.
Warm Regards,
Girish Wagh
