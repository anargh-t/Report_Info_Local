Safety
Our core ambition is to achieve a 
workplace where Zero Harm can be 
realised and maintained. We continue 
to focus on our three safety pillars 
of Safe Place, Safe Systems and Safe 
People, which provide the framework 
for our approach to continual 
improvement on our glidepath to 
Zero Harm. 
We continue to focus on our internal 
auditing activity and data aggregation 
and analysis capabilities to understand 
where there are opportunities for 
further improvement. Our programme 
of safety process automation 
contributes to us meeting the 
requirements set out in our Safety 
Management System, allowing 
us to monitor and analyse data in 
realâ€‘time, quickly identifying and 
addressing potential issues and further 
contributing to our culture of safety 
and continuous improvement.
Our Safety Management System is continually refined to provide an effective 
framework for safety organisation, and our commitment to maintaining the highest 
standards of occupational health, safety and wellbeing for our colleagues, partners 
and clients is reflected in our ongoing certification to ISO 45001 .
