Looking ahead to FY26, we 
anticipate sustained growth 
in the domestic market due 
to its strong fundamentals, 
despite global headwinds. 
Demand is expected to 
rise, driven by higher fleet 
utilisation, financial support 
from rate cuts, lower crude 
oil prices, and a renewed 
focus on large-scale 
infrastructure projects. At 
the same time, we remain 
mindful of the potential 
impact of new regulations 
mandating truck cabin air 
conditioning on vehicle 
prices. We will continue to 
closely monitor government 
infrastructure spending 
and growth across key 
end-use segments. With an 
expansive product portfolio, 
smart digital solutions and 
new nameplate launches 
on the anvil, Tata Motors 
Commercial Vehicles is 
well-positioned to leverage 
market opportunities 
and maintain its 
growth trajectory.
