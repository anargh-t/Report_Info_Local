The community is not 
just another stakeholder 
in the business but is, in 
fact, the very purpose of 
its existence.
India’s ability to reduce poverty and inequality in the next two 
decades is critical for global prosperity. We have an unprecedented 
chance to use tools like AI and public data infrastructure to address 
development gaps, and to scale local solutions when it comes to 
challenges like climate adaptation. At the same time, India is the 
first country in the world to enshrine corporate giving into law.
Long before corporate giving became law, the Tata Group has 
played a pivotal role in India’s development journey, shaping the 
nation through institution‑building and contributions to economic 
and social progress. Today, the Group is leveraging technology and 
innovation to tackle emerging challenges such as climate change 
and environmental conservation, while continuing to deepen its 
efforts within communities to solve complex social challenges like 
access to education and healthcare. 
Between FY21 and FY25, the Tata Group invested over  
I7,550 crore ($1 Bn) in corporate social responsibility initiatives. 
In FY25 alone, the Tata Group’s CSR initiatives impacted over 
five million lives across the country — a testament to the Group’s 
continued commitment to driving sustainable and equitable 
development. As our philanthropic scope has matured and 
advanced, so has our approach. Today, we differentiate our efforts 
by solving complex problems at scale; serving the underserved; 
harmonising people and planet; and harnessing technology to 
amplify indigenous solutions.
