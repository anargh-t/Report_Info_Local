Key priorities
KYC
Physical shareholders are mandatorily 
required to update their KYC viz. PAN, 
address, contact details, specimen 
signatures, in prescribed forms and 
with supporting documents, before 
commencing any service request. 
Post updating the KYC all outstanding 
dividends are released directly into the 
bank account electronically.
Dematerialisation 
Issue of physical share certificate has 
been repelled by SEBI and hence, 
the Company encourages its physical 
shareholders to dematerialise their 
holding in the Company.
Outstanding unclaimed/unpaid 
dividends 
Reminder letters are posted to the 
shareholder encouraging them to claim 
their outstanding dividends from the 
Company. Revalidate and reissue stale 
dividend warrant on receipt of request 
from shareholders. 
IEPF documentation  
and process
The shareholders, whose shares and 
dividend amounts are transferred 
to IEPF Authority, should submit 
the perquisite documents with the 
Company/it’s RTA to obtain the 
Entitlement Letter. File form IEPF‑5 
on the MCA portal, to enable the 
Company submit the E‑Verification 
Report with IEPF Authority. The 
Company assists the shareholders 
through the reclaim process.
