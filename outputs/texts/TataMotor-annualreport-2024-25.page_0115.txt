•  We have a robust governance mechanism to monitor occupational health and 
safety, whereby reviews are conducted at multiple levels. Safety performance 
is embedded in both corporate and plant‑level Balanced Scorecards (BSC) and is 
measured through the Proactive Safety Index (PSI) II, which emphasises leading 
indicators and preventive actions.
