disbursement curve analysis. However, there are no individual assumptions that can be reasonably expected to move 
over the next financial year to such a degree that it would result in a material adjustment to the warranty provision.
The Company notes that changes in the automotive environment presents its own significant challenges, particularly 
due to the lack of maturity and historical data available at this time to help inform estimates for future warranty 
claims, as well as any associated recoveries from suppliers due to such claims. The related provisions are made with 
the Company’s best estimate at this time to settle such obligations in the future but will be required to be continually 
refined as sufficient, real-world data becomes available.  
The discount on the warranty provision is calculated using a risk-free discount rate as the risks specific to the liability, 
such as inflation, are included in the base calculation.
Estimates of the future costs of warranty actions are subject to numerous uncertainties, including the enactment 
of  new  laws  and  regulations,  the  number  of  vehicles  affected  by  a  service  or  recall  action  and  the  nature  or  final 
cost of the corrective action. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the inputs to these assumptions, it is 
reasonably possible that the actual cost expenditure over an extended period of time could be materially different to 
the estimate in a range of amounts that cannot be reasonably estimated. 
Estimates are made of the expected reimbursement claim based upon historical levels of recoveries from supplier, 
adjusted for inflation and applied to the population of vehicles under warranty as on Balance Sheet date. Supplier 
reimbursements are recognised as separate asset “Recoverable from Suppliers” under Other financial assets. (Refer
