Jaguar  Land  Rover  has  cumulative  investment  plans  of 
£18  billion  until  FY28  in  its  industrial  footprint,  vehicle 
programmes,  autonomous,  AI  and  digital  technologies 
and people skills, as a part of its Reimagine strategy. The 
investment plans of Jaguar Land Rover will be continued 
to  be  funded  from  internal  accruals.  Tata  Motors  Ltd 
(TML) and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPVL) 
expects to meet the investments primarily out of their 
own  operating  cash  flows.  Capital  investments  in  Tata 
Passenger Electric Mobility Ltd (TPEML) are well funded 
in  the  near  term  from  the  funds  received  from  TPG 
Rise  Climate  in  line  with  the  strategy  roadmap.  Any 
additional funding requirements if needed, can be met 
through  loans,  incentives  and  other  means  from  time 
to  time.  Despite  significantly  higher  investments  and 
multiple  headwinds,  we  are  expecting  our  business  to 
be self-sustaining and we aim sustain net cash.
