4   Fostering leadership in  
  Health and Safety
Tata Motors operates with the unwavering belief that Safety & Wellbeing is not 
just a priority, but a non‑negotiable condition of doing business. This commitment 
is embedded across all business verticals — from manufacturing and mobility 
services to product development and after‑sales. Our organisation is guided by a 
robust ISO 45001:2018‑aligned Occupational Health & Safety Management System 
(OHSMS) and a multi‑tiered Safety, Health & Sustainability (SHS) governance 
framework, ensuring leadership accountability and safety integration from 
boardrooms to shop floors and safety is integrated into every decision, operation, 
and engagement.
In a validation of Tata Motors’ progress toward safety maturity, an external agency 
dss+ conducted a Rapid Safety System Assessment across four pillars: Leadership, 
Integrated Governance, Incident Management, and Business Partner Management 
in FY25 and observed strong strategic intent, robust governance alignment, and 
visible leadership commitment across all levels.
