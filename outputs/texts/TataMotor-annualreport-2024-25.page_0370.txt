iv)  Long Term Incentive Scheme – Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) 
During the year ended March 31, 2025, the company introduced a cash-settled Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for 
certain employees. The LTIP is based on the value of phantom shares, which mirror the value of the Tata Motors Ltd 
share price, but does not confer any ownership or voting rights. As the LTIP is cash-settled and based on phantom 
shares, it is non-dilutive to existing shareholders. The LTIP vests over a three-year period, effective from June 2024. 
The scheme will provide a cash payment to certain employees based on the Group’s performance against long-term 
business metrics related to performance and strategic priorities and the share price of Tata Motors Limited over a 
period of three years. This new LTIP has been accounted for under Ind AS 102 Share-based payments.
