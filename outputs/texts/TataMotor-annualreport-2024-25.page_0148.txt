Governance
Sustainable supply chain
At the core of our sustainability journey 
is a dream that is bigger than just 
automobiles — it is the dream of leaving 
behind a greener, healthier planet for 
future generations. With ambitious goals 
to achieve net‑zero emissions by 2040 
for Passenger Vehicles (PV) and 2045 for 
Commercial Vehicles (CV), we understand 
that no dream can be fulfilled alone. 
Sustainability is a shared responsibility, 
and the Company has committed to 
empowering its vast network of suppliers 
to embrace sustainable practices. It’s 
not just a supply chain anymore — it’s 
a partnership of purpose, built on a 
foundation of trust, respect, and unity.
Tata Motor’s sustainable supply 
chain framework
Tata Motor’s Sustainable Supply Chain 
Framework reflects our aspiration 
to weave sustainability into the very 
fabric of our supply chain. It’s a step 
towards responsible growth that inspires 
partners, stakeholders, and industries 
to walk together on the path of progress 
with purpose. The implementation and 
oversight of supply chain sustainability 
programmes are overseen by the 
Executive Management, who report 
regularly to the Board of Directors on 
performance and strategic direction.
Our Supply Chain Sustainability 
framework is built on four key pillars:
I
Ambition
A clear vision for sustainability – 
The foundation of this framework lies 
in Ambition — a clear and resolute 
vision that aligns Tata Motors’ supply 
chain goals with its larger sustainability 
mission. It establishes precise KPIs and 
targets, setting the stage for meaningful 
and measurable progress. This ambition 
isn’t just an internal pursuit — it calls on 
suppliers and partners to align with the 
same vision, fostering collective growth.

Enablers: Aikyam: ‘A dream 
fuelled by vision and unity’
At the heart of Tata Motors’ Supply 
Chain Sustainability strategy is it 
Aikyam, a Sanskrit word that means 
‘unity’. This isn’t just a platform — it’s 
a movement that binds suppliers, 
employees, and stakeholders under 
a single vision: creating a sustainable 
future, together. Aikyam serves as 
the bridge between ambition and 
action, fostering collaboration through 
workshops, knowledge‑sharing sessions, 
collective learning and high impact 
projects. At the core of ‘AIKYAM’ 
are our ‘Apex Chapters’, strategically 
positioned to prioritise and spearhead 
flagship projects aimed at pioneering 
sustainability solutions within our 
industry. Within each ‘Apex Chapter’, 
our ‘Affiliate Chapters’ delve deep 
into specific sustainability hotspots, 
taking targeted actions to address key 
challenges. The supplier screening 
exercise basis business relevance on 
the commodity specific risks, helps us 
identify the significant suppliers who are 
integrated as part of this forum.
Every movement needs a guiding 
compass, and Tata Motors achieves 
this through comprehensive policies. 
From an enhanced Supplier Code 
of Conduct to robust procurement 
policies, these principles ensure 
that every action aligns with high 
ethical and environmental standards. 
The purchasing practices are reviewed 
to ensure alignment to the SCoC 
and to avoid potential conflicts. This 
governance framework not only 
mitigates risks but also creates a culture 
of trust and integrity, aiming to set 
a gold standard for the industry.

Process: Building resilience 
with robust processes:
The sustainable supply chain framework 
integrates Sustainability at all stages 
of the supplier life cycle. Starting from 
the Request for Quotation (RFQ) and 
Manufacturing Site Assessments to 
an exhaustive desk‑based annual ESG 
Supplier Assessment Questionnaire 
(SAQ) for existing suppliers, helping 
Tata Motors identify those leading 
the way and offering corrective and 
improvement plans to those who need 
to improve. By carefully evaluating 
supplier partners at every step, 
Tata Motors will ensure only those who 
share its commitment to sustainability 
become a long‑term partner of 
its ecosystem. Risk Management 
Frameworks are also being incorporated 
to proactively identify and mitigate 
risks, ensuring seamless governance and 
continuous improvement.
Through these refined processes, 
Tata Motors emphasises that 
sustainability is not an afterthought 
— it is embedded into every decision, 
creating a supply chain that is resilient, 
agile, and future‑ready.
