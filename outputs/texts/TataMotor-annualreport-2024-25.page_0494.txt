Other short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated at amortised cost which is approximately equal to their 
fair value.
The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price 
and for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount 
rate  equivalent  to  the  risk-free  rate  of  return,  adjusted  for  the  credit  spread  considered  by  the  lenders  for 
instruments of similar maturity.
Management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of its financial instruments. However, there are 
inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, substantially for all financial instruments, the fair 
value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have 
realised or paid in sale transactions as of respective dates. As such, the fair value of the financial instruments 
subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each period end.
(b)   Offsetting :
Certain  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  subject  to  offsetting  where  there  is  currently  a  legally 
enforceable right to set off recognised amounts and the Company intends to either settle   on a net basis, or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability, simultaneously.
Certain derivative financial assets and financial liabilities are subject to master netting arrangements, whereby 
in the case of insolvency, derivative financial assets and financial liabilities will be settled on a net basis.      
The following table discloses the amounts that have been offset, in arriving at the balance sheet presentation 
and the amounts that are available for offset only under certain conditions as at March 31, 2025:
