*Individual  projects  less  than  10%  of  total  Intangible  assets  under  development  have  been  clubbed  together  in 
various projects.
Original  plan  is  considered  as  that  plan  which  is  approved  and  on  the  basis  of  which  implementation  progress  is 
evaluated. Such original plan includes management’s estimates and assumptions w.r.t future business, economy / 
industry and regulatory environments.

Impairment assessment of Jaguar Land Rover Business
The operations of subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), excluding equity accounted investments, represents a single cash-
generating  unit  (CGU).  This  is  because  of  the  closely  connected  nature  of  the  cash  flows  and  the  degree  of  integrated 
development and manufacturing activities. 
In accordance with accounting standard, management have performed an annual impairment assessment as at January 
31, 2025 using the value in use (“VIU”) approach to determine the recoverable value of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”). 
A subsequent assessment has been performed to the year end date which has determined that there have been no events 
or changes in circumstances which would have changed the outcome of the assessment performed as at January, 31.
The impairment assessment determined that the CGU recoverable value exceeded the carrying amount by ₹ 63,101 crores 
(GBP 5,700  million) (2024:₹ 68,267 crores (GBP 6,500  million) and therefore no impairment was identified. The decrease 
in headroom has largely been driven by an increase to the value of the CGU offset by improved performance projections 
forecast for future periods following cycle plan actions and other strategic changes. It was further determined that this 
decrease did not require the reversal of the previously recorded impairment loss.
JLR has considered it appropriate to undertake the impairment assessment with reference to the approved business plan 
that was in effect as at the assessment date. The business plan includes a five-year cash flow forecast and contains growth 
rates that are primarily a function of the JLR’s Cycle Plan assumptions, historic performance and management’s expectation 
of future market developments through to 2029/30.
In  estimating  the  future  cash  flows  management  have  given  due  consideration  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  of  forecast 
information and have adjusted some of the assumptions in the business plan to take into account possible variations in 
the amount or timing of the cashflows. In doing so, management has incorporated execution risks associated with our 
‘Reimagine’ strategy and the transition to electrified powertrain into the VIU, as well as other risks that may impact future 
cash flows.
Climate risk 
JLR recognises that the potential impact of climate risk to areas such as supply chain, operations, and material and compliance 
costs may result in variations to the timing and amounts of future cash flows. As such climate risk is incorporated into the 
development of our forecast cash flows in the VIU by reference to our climate change risk assessment. These risks are 
principally reflected by the risk adjustments related to the variable profit and volumes which would be most affected by 
climate change events, for example, scarcity of certain commodities driving up costs and therefore adversely impacting 
variable profit.
