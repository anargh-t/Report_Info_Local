Compensated absences
Tata Motors Limited and some of its subsidiaries and joint operations provide for the encashment of leave or 
leave with pay subject to certain rules. The employees are entitled to accumulate leave subject to certain limits, 
for future encashment. The liability is provided based on the number of days of unutilised leave at each balance 
sheet date on the basis of an actuarial valuation
Remeasurement gains and losses
Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling and the return on assets 
(excluding interest) relating to retirement benefit plans, are recognised directly in other comprehensive income 
in the period in which they arise. Remeasurement recorded in other comprehensive income is not reclassified to 
consolidated statement of profit and loss. Actuarial gains and losses relating to long-term employee benefits are 
recognised in the consolidated statement of profit and loss in the period in which they arise.
Measurement date
The measurement date of retirement plans is March 31.
The present value of the defined benefit liability and the related current service cost and past service cost are 
measured using projected unit credit method.
The present value of the post-employment benefit obligations depends on a number of factors, it is determined 
on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/(income) 
for pensions include the discount rate, inflation and mortality assumptions. Any changes in these assumptions 
will impact upon the carrying amount of post-employment benefit obligations.
