approach for SOx emissions, and using maximum concentration levels for NOx and TPM emissions from stack monitoring reports.

*Construction and demolition waste for FY24 has been restated due to enhanced coverage of waste generation points. Non-hazardous waste for FY24 does 
not include plastic waste and scrap disposal that were recorded in lots or numbers.
**Non-hazardous waste disposed in lots have been converted into Metric tonnes using an average conversion factor from the generated value in FY 25 due to 
an improvement in tracking processes leading to a marginal increase in the waste footprint reported. Non-hazardous waste includes ferrous and non-ferrous 
metal and other scrap like packaging waste, plastic, rubber, glass and auto components that were sold to scrap dealers and not to the primary recyclers. 
Recycling data has been certified through declarations by scrap dealers who in turn sell to end-users who are secondary metallurgical industries or recyclers 
that convert scrap into other products.
