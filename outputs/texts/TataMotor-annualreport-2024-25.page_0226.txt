Every quarter, an update on the summary of cases received and resolved during the quarter, and actions taken in cases 
where violations were noted, is presented to the Audit Committee.
The Company also has a Code of Conduct for Value Chain Partners and requires them to submit a declaration affirming 
their  commitment  to  adhering  to  the  guidelines  in  it.  The  said  Code  of  Conduct  also  encompasses  the  protection  of 
human rights.
In  line  with  our  commitment  towards  gender  inclusion  and  diversity,  and  creating  a  safe,  fair,  and  just  workplace,  the 
Company has the Prevention of Sexual Harassment at Workplace (POSH) Policy. The POSH setup includes various Internal 
Committees (ICs). In addition, an APEX Internal Committee acts as an Appellate Body and is responsible for disseminating 
this policy. We have formulated standard guidelines to address the issue of sexual harassment at the workplace. These 
guidelines  are  administered  by  the  location/sub-unit  specific  committees  at  the  local  (Plant/Regions)  level.  All  women 
associates (permanent, temporary, contractual, and trainees), women service providers, as well as any woman visiting the 
Company’s workplace, are covered under this policy. Any kind of objectionable conduct is subject to disciplinary action.
