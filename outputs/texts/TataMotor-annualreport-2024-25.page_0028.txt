External  
environment
FY25 was another eventful year wherein overall CV industry volumes were marginally lower than FY24. 
Despite challenges through the year, Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles achieved industry‑leading growth 
in trucks and commercial passenger carriers, thereby strengthening its market share as well as improving 
the realisation. With continued growth in downstream and international business, the Company was 
able to deliver healthy financials in FY25. Actions on Sustainability transition are progressing as per 
plan; reinforcing our commitment to green, future‑ready technologies, the Company has developed and 
introduced India’s first hydrogen‑powered heavy‑duty truck for real‑world testing, while our e‑bus fleet 
continues to grow across Indian cities, collectively covering over 30 crore km cumulatively.
The industry witnessed a dynamic 
FY25, marked by distinct quarterly 
shifts. Q1 began on a positive note, 
with growth led by the M&HCV 
segment. Q2 saw a moderation in 
demand due to monsoon disruptions, 
reduced fleet utilisation, and slower 
execution of infrastructure projects. 
In Q3, the industry saw sequential 
recovery, aided by the resumption 
of construction and mining activity 
and festive season demand. The 
momentum continued into Q4, 
indicating improving macroeconomic 
stability. Despite early challenges, the 
industry closed the year with signs of 
recovery for the coming year.
  Commodity price movements 
and strategic implications
In FY25, steel prices in India saw a 
significant decline, driven by global 
oversupply, subdued demand, 
cheaper imports from China, lower 
input costs, and increased domestic 
production capacity. This downward 
trend, especially in the latter half of 
the year, offered some relief to OEM 
margins. However, the overall volatility 
— shaped by global supply‑demand 
imbalances and geopolitical tensions 
— continued to impact vehicle pricing, 
procurement strategies, and cost 
structures. As a result, raw material 
management remained a critical focus 
area for manufacturers across the 
commercial vehicle value chain.
Shift from mini trucks 
to pickups
In FY25, customer preferences began 
shifting from mini trucks to pickups, 
particularly in rural and semi‑urban 
markets. This trend was influenced 
by rising costs in the mini truck 
segment post‑BS6 implementation, 
including higher EMIs and stagnant 
freight rates. Pick‑ups gained traction 
due to their higher payload capacity, 
improved drivability, and aspirational 
appeal. While mini trucks continue 
to serve important use cases, OEMs 
are expanding their pick‑up offerings 
to address evolving needs in last‑mile 
delivery and small business operations.
