Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP has 
provided limted assurance on data reported under 
this indicator.
* The numbers for FY 24 have been restated due to a change in methodology to include only the air emissions from associated stacks and using 
fuel based approach for SOx emissions, and using maximum concentration levels for NOx and TPM emissions from stack monitoring reports.

has  been  carried  out  by  an  external  agency?    If  yes,  name  of  the 
external agency.
Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting Services LLP has provided 
reasonable assurance on data reported under this indicator.
* The numbers for FY 24 have been restated due to reclassification of green attribute ownership for renewable electricity, enhanced coverage 
of fuel consumption points and extended coverage of fugitive emissions from refrigerants. 
**The intensity adjusted for PPP has been restated following the guidelines set forth in SEBI’s circular dated December 20, 2024, which outlines 
Industry  Standards  Forum  guidance  for  BRSR  Core.  The  PPP  factor  has  been  sourced  from  IMF  database.  https://www.imf.org/external/

# The emission factors for calculation of Scope 1 emissions are based on 2024 UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting 
Version 1.1 from DEFRA
## Scope 2 GHG emissions reported are calculated based on market-based approach. The above Scope 2 numbers are after adjustments for 
International Renewable Energy Certificates(iRECs) purchased. For grid electricity the latest applicable CEA published grid emission factor has 
been used.
8.  Does the entity have any project related to reducing Green House Gas emission? If Yes, then provide details.
We are driving decarbonization in our operations by minimizing greenhouse gas (Scope-1 and Scope-2) emissions through 
optimizing fossil fuel use in our manufacturing processes, switching from fossil fuel to electrical heating, continued energy 
conservation measures and transitioning to renewable electricity. We are a signatory to Climate Group RE100 for achieving 
100% renewable electricity use in operations by 2030. The total installed capacity of Rooftop Solar amounts to 55.5 MW 
augmented by short term Green Power Purchase agreements and Renewable Energy Certificates. 
The Company continued to add on-site Renewable Energy (solar) generation capacity in FY 2024-25:
