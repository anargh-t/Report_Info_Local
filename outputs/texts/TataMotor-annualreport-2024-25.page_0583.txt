*Comprises of Co2, CH4, N20, HFCs gases. The emission factors for calculation of Scope 1 emissions are based on 2024 UK Government GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting Version 1.1 from DEFRA.
**The numbers for FY 24 have been restated due to enhanced coverage of fuel consumption points and extended coverage of fugitive emissions from 
refrigerants.
#Scope 2 GHG emissions based on market-based approach are after adjustments for International Renewable Energy Certificates(iRECs) purchased. For grid 
electricity the latest applicable CEA published grid emission factor has been used.
## The numbers for FY 24 have been restated due to reclassification of green attribute ownership for renewable electricity.
