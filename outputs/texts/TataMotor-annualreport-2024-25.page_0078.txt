Sustainability –  
Project Aalingana
The Tata Group’s sustainability strategy is guided by Project 
Aalingana, which is driven by the vision to protect the planet and 
build the future through the technologies of tomorrow.  While the 
principles of social and environmental responsibility are deeply 
ingrained in the group’s founding principles, Project Aalingana 
seeks to build on this foundation to position the group among 
sustainability leaders globally. 
Aalingana commits each Tata Company to a set of ambitious goals 
under the three inter‑connected pillars of: 
1
2
3
Driving  
Net Zero
Pioneering Circular 
Economies
Preserving Nature 
& Biodiversity
The Tata Group Sustainability Council, headed by the Chairman, 
Tata Sons, provides strategic guidance and oversight to Group 
Companies on sustainability.
