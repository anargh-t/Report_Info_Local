Pioneering circular economies
In FY24, TML launched Tatva – a 
comprehensive framework to 
becoming a truly circular business. In 
the absence of a universally accepted 
international standard or framework, 
TATVA was created to embed 
circularity in our core operations. 
Tatva represents the integration of 
circular economy principles across 
the enterprise — impacting design, 
engineering, procurement, customer 
care, aftermarket services, and end‑of‑
life management.
The framework is structured under 
three key action areas: Carbon 
Efficiency, Resource Efficiency, and 
Revenue Generation, four pathways – 
Material, Energy, Lifetime & Utilisation, 
and 12 key elements supported by 
22 robust metrics.
To establish a strong foundation for 
Carbon and Resource Efficiency, we 
have established baseline data across 
all our platforms and developed a 
targeted commodity strategy aligned 
with our ambitious 2030 goals. These 
initiatives are integral to our ‘Design 
for Circularity’ approach. Furthermore, 
renewable energy has been adopted 
as a central theme to drive carbon 
efficiency throughout our supply chain.
On the revenue front, we have 
launched Project Sanjeevani to 
expand our Prolife product portfolio 
and unlock new value streams from 
circular models. Simultaneously, we 
are enhancing the capabilities of our  
Re.Wi.Re centres by implementing 
processes that enable components 
to move through higher loops 
of circularity — such as Reuse, 
Refurbishment, and Remanufacturing 
— rather than going directly to 
recycling. Going forward, we 
will strengthen our value chain 
partnerships to advance circularity 
and introduce solutions that enhance 
the utilisation and lifecycle value of 
our products.
