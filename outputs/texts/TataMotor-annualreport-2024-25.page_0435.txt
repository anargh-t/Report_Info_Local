Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override 
of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud 
may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
