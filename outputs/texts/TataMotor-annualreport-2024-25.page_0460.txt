(i)   Rights, preferences and restrictions attached to shares :
• 
• 
• 
• 
In respect of every Ordinary share of ₹2 each (whether fully or partly paid), voting rights shall be in the same 
proportion as the capital paid up on such Ordinary share bears to the total paid up Ordinary share capital of 
the Company. 
The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is subject to the approval of the shareholders in the ensuing 
Annual General Meeting.  
In the event of liquidation, the shareholders are eligible to receive the remaining assets of the Company after 
distribution of all preferential amounts, in proportion to their shareholdings.
The  Board  of  Directors,  at  its  meeting  held  on  July  25,  2023,  approved  (subject  to,  inter  alia,  obtaining  the 
regulatory and other approvals including from the Hon’ble National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”)) a Scheme 
of  Arrangement  (“Scheme”)  for  reduction,  through  cancellation  of  the  entire  ‘A’  Ordinary  Share  capital 
and in consideration thereof, issue and allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the Company, in the manner as 
contemplated in the Scheme.
The Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 
1, 2024. Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crores) and 
issued  and  allotted  35,59,52,028  New  Ordinary  Shares  of  ₹2.00  each  (₹71  crores)  to  TML  Securities  Trust,  in 
terms of the Scheme. The resultant difference of ₹31 crores is recorded in Securities Premium Account. TML 
Securities  Trust  was  able  to  credit  New  ordinary  Shares  to  the  respective  ‘A’  Ordinary  shareholders,  except 
173,389 New Ordinary Shares. Of these 86,411 new Ordinary Shares, have been transferred to Investor Education 
and Protection Fund on March 13, 2025. Remaining 86,978 new Ordinary Shares, yet to be transferred to the 
ultimate shareholders/beneficial owners by TML Securities Trust as on March 31, 2025, are consolidated in the 
standalone  financial  statements.  These  86,978  new  Ordinary  Shares  are  presently  held  in  an  escrow  demat 
account of the Company. 
The  total  expenses  of  ₹70  crores  (including  ₹53  crores  for  the  year  ended  March  31,  2025)  incurred  on  the 
cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares have been accounted through retained earnings. 
The issue of new Ordinary Shares as consideration for reduction by way of cancellation of ‘A’ Ordinary Shares, 
was considered to be ‘Deemed Dividend’ in the hands of ‘A’ Ordinary Shareholders in terms of the Income Tax 
Act, 1961. The TDS liability of the Company on the aforesaid ‘Deemed Dividend’, amounting to ₹1,073 crores, 
has been funded through sale of requisite number of new Ordinary Shares, in the manner as contemplated in 
the Scheme.
