The  other  information  comprises  the  information  included 
in  the  Company’s  Integrated  Annual  Report  (but  does  not 
include  the  BRSR  Core,  select  BRSR  and  GRI  indicators  and 
assurance  reports  thereon).  The  Company’s 
Integrated 
Annual Report is expected to be made available to us after 
the date of this assurance report. 
• 
• 
In connection with our assurance on the BRSR Core attributes, 
our responsibility is to read the other information identified 
above when it becomes available, and in doing so, consider 
whether other information is materially inconsistent with the 
BRSR Core, or our knowledge obtained in the assurance, or 
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
When we read the annual report, if we conclude that there 
is  a  material  misstatement  therein,  we  are  required  to 
communicate the matter to Those Charged With Governance 
and  describe  actions  applicable  under  the  applicable  laws 
and regulations.
Intended use or purpose
The  ISI  and  our  reasonable  assurance  report  are  intended 
for users who have reasonable knowledge of the BRSR Core 
attributes, the reporting criteria and ISI and who have read 
the  information  in  the  ISI  with  reasonable  diligence  and 
understand that the ISI is prepared and assured at appropriate 
levels of materiality.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Management’s responsibilities for the 
identified Sustainability Information (ISI) 
The  management  of  the  Company  acknowledge  and 
understand their responsibility for: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
designing, 
internal 
implementing  and  maintaining 
controls  relevant  to  the  preparation  of  the  ISI  that  is 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or error;
selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the 
ISI, taking into account applicable laws and regulations, 
if  any,  related  to  reporting  on  the  ISI,  identification  of 
key  aspects,  engagement  with  stakeholders,  content, 
preparation  and  presentation  of  the  ISI  in  accordance 
with the reporting criteria; disclosure of the applicable 
criteria  used  for  preparation  of  the  ISI  in  the  relevant 
report/statement; 
preparing/fairly  stating/properly  calculating  the  ISI  in 
accordance with the reporting criteria; and 
ensuring  the  reporting  criteria  is  available  for  the 
intended users with relevant explanation;
establishing  targets,  goals  and  other  performance 
measures,  and  implementing  actions  to  achieve  such 
239
targets, goals and performance measures;
responsible for providing the details of the management 
personnel  who  takes  ownership  of  the  ISI  disclosed  in 
the report;
ensuring 
applicable contracts;
compliance  with 
law, 
regulation  or 
•  making judgements and estimates that are reasonable in 
the circumstances; 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
identifying and describing any inherent limitations in the 
measurement  or  evaluation  of  information  covered  by 
assurance in accordance with the reporting criteria; 
preventing and detecting fraud;
selecting  the  content  of  the  ISI,  including  identifying 
and  engaging  with  intended  users  to  understand  their 
information needs;
informing us of other information that will be included 
with the ISI;
supervision of other staff involved in the preparation of 
the ISI.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing 
the reporting process for the Company’s ISI.
Inherent limitations 
The preparation of the Company’s BRSR information requires 
the management to establish or interpret the criteria, make 
determinations  about  the  relevancy  of  information  to  be 
included,  and  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect 
the reported information.
Measurement  of  certain  amounts  and  BRSR  Core  metrics, 
some of which are estimates, is subject to substantial inherent 
measurement  uncertainty,  for  example,  GHG  emissions, 
water  footprint,  energy  footprint.  Obtaining  sufficient 
appropriate evidence to support our opinion does not reduce 
the uncertainty in the amounts and metrics.
