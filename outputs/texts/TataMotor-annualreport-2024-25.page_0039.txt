Strategic and 
performance review 
Outpacing industry in
high-growth segments
 In FY25, we outpaced the industry in 
high‑growth segments, delivering an 
11% growth in the SUV segment. This 
has been driven by the strong demand 
for the Tata Punch, which became the 
highest‑selling model in the industry in 
CY24, along with the sustained demand 
for the Tata Nexon. The launch of 
India’s first SUV Coupe, the Tata Curvv, 
further contributed to this momentum, 
receiving widespread appreciation 
from both the media and customers. 
Additionally, in the CNG segment, 
we recorded a remarkable 53% y‑o‑y 
growth, bolstered by a robust twin‑
cylinder portfolio and the successful 
launch of Nexon iCNG, aligned with 
evolving customer preferences.
Strengthening  
customer experience
 A key focus this year has been on 
strengthening customer experience 
across touchpoints through 
comprehensive initiatives. These 
include ramping up service capacity 
with 1,300+ new bays across India, 
modernising over 450 workshops, 
leveraging AI and analytics for more 
efficient vehicle diagnostics, enhanced 
technician training and optimisation 
of service logistics. We have also 
revamped our roadside assistance 
programme, including live tracking and 
increased on‑site repairs to improve 
responsiveness and effectiveness. 
These combined actions have led to 
an enhanced after‑sales experience, 
leading to a significant increase in 
positive mentions by customers.
Driving manufacturing 
excellence
We are advancing manufacturing 
excellence through the modernisation 
of our operations with Industry 
4.0‑enabled shops, aimed at 
significantly enhancing efficiency, 
precision, and agility. A strong focus 
has been placed on improving product 
quality and reliability by leveraging 
digital and AI tools and revamped 
processes and frameworks, which 
have especially strengthened our 
software maturity. In parallel, we 
have accelerated our cost reduction 
efforts through strategic sourcing 
initiatives, increased localisation, 
and innovative value‑engineering 
practices. As an additional step to 
bolster our manufacturing capacity, we 
acquired a new facility in Panapakkam, 
Tamil Nadu.
