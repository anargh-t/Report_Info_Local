In FY25, the global economy experienced moderated growth, 
influenced by persistent inflationary pressures, tight monetary 
policies in developed markets and geopolitical uncertainties. 
These  factors  contributed  to  cautious  consumer  spending

global growth is expected to slow to 2.3% in 2025 from 2.7% 
in 2024.

in  manufacturing  and  services.  China’s  growth  was  weaker 
than expected, with a slowdown in the real estate sector and 
industrial activity. The Asia-Pacific region is projected to be 
the fastest-growing.
The  automotive  industry  faced  significant  challenges  amid 
these  macroeconomic  headwinds.  High  interest  rates  and 
tighter  credit  conditions  in  key  markets  such  as  the  US  and 
Europe,  dampened  consumer  demand,  particularly  in  mass 
market segment.
