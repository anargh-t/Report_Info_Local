Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s 
internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial 
statements  based  on  our  audit.  We  conducted  our  audit  in 
accordance  with  the  Guidance  Note  and  the  Standards  on 
Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the 
extent  applicable  to  an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements.  Those  Standards 
and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical 
requirements  and  plan  and  perform  the  audit  to  obtain 
reasonable  assurance  about  whether  adequate  internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements were 
established  and  maintained  and  if  such  controls  operated 
effectively in all material respects.
Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit 
evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  and  their 
internal  financial 
operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  included 
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk 
that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating 
the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  standalone  financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We  believe  that  the  audit  evidence  we  have  obtained  is 
sufficient  and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for  our  audit 
opinion  on  the  Company’s  internal  financial  controls  with 
reference to financial statements.
