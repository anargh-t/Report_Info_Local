Tata Motors’ state‑of‑the‑art  
Re.Wi.Re. (Recycle with Respect) 
facility is designed to responsibly 
dismantle end‑of‑life passenger and 
commercial vehicles across all brands. 
Leveraging globally benchmarked and 
optimised processes, these facilities 
enable safe, sustainable, and efficient 
vehicle scrapping and recycling.
Through Re.Wi.Re., we aim to 
strengthen value capture in 
downstream businesses, generate 
employment opportunities, and 
contribute meaningfully to reducing 
environmental pollution from ageing 
vehicles. Aligned with our commitment 
to sustainability and circular economy 
principles, we are actively working 
to scale Re.Wi.Re. facilities across 
the country — enhancing value chain 
efficiency while fostering a cleaner, 
greener future.
Tata Prolife
Tata Motors Prolife stands as a proven 
case of circular economy in the country 
for the last 25 years.
It is a pioneering aftermarket support 
initiative which aims to remanufacture 
old and used vehicle aggregates to 
factory standards for delivering original 
equipment like performance and 
extending the useful life of vehicle.
Tata Motors Prolife remanufactures 
entire range of Engine long blocks 
fitted on Tata Motors Commercial 
vehicles with emission compliance 
norms ranging from BSI to BSVI.
Apart from engines, other products in 
Prolife portfolio are Clutch assemblies, 
Cabins, After treatment systems and 
Fuel Injection equipment.
Project Sanjeevani has been launched 
with a vision to take quantum leaps 
on Circular economy goals while 
Tata Motors Prolife is expanding 
its portfolio to a wide variety of 
components in the near future.
Looking beyond the current industrial 
linear model of Take – Make – Waste, 
Tata Motors Prolife has imbibed the 
circular economy model and redefined 
Growth by Take – Make – Reuse 
approach to remanufacture and reuse 
with focus on positive ecological and 
social benefits.
End of life parts are reclaimed and 
rebuilt through innovative salvaging 
processes and re‑machining. 
This enables the re‑use of these parts 
for another life and in turn serving 
the objective of parts circularity by 
avoiding the use of virgin materials for 
manufacturing fresh parts.
