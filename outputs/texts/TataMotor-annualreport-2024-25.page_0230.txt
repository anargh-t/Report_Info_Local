Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting 
Services LLP has provided reasonable 
assurance on data reported under 
this indicator.
5.  Has  the  entity  implemented  a  mechanism  for  Zero  Liquid  Discharge?  If  Yes,  provide  details  of  its  coverage 
and implementation.
Our  operations  in  India  extend  across  Jharkhand,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Uttarakhand,  Maharashtra,  and  Karnataka.  The 
management and disposal of treated effluents generated during plant operations are governed by the specific operating 
consent orders issued by the respective State Pollution Control Boards, which our plants strictly follow.
In line with these consent orders, several plants have implemented tertiary treatment systems, such as Reverse Osmosis 
(RO), to recycle treated effluents for reuse in processes. Others adopt a Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) approach by repurposing 
treated effluents for secondary applications, including toilet flushing and supporting greenbelt development within the 
plant and surrounding areas.
This  year,  we  have  taken  additional  steps  to  conserve  freshwater  and  optimize  its  usage.  In  Pune  and  Jamshedpur,  for 
example, we have reduced freshwater consumption by increasing the use of treated effluents in our processes. This includes 
the installation of tertiary treatment systems with RO membranes and the utilization of treated sewage wastewater for 
plant process water requirements from nearby sources—such as PCMC’s treated sewage usage at the Pimpri plant and 
township sewage at the Jamshedpur plant. Furthermore, efforts are underway to enhance water sustainability through 
rainwater harvesting and recharge initiatives both within and around plant premises. Tata Motors is committed to achieving 
a ‘Water Positive’ status by 2030 in all its operations and townships.
Aligned with these consent orders/authorizations, plants have implemented comprehensive tertiary treatment systems, 
such  as  Reverse  Osmosis,  to  recycle  treated  effluents  for  process  reuse.  Others  ensure  Zero  Liquid  Discharge  by 
repurposing treated effluents for secondary purposes, such as toilet flushing and/or maintaining greenbelt development 
within  plant  premises  and  adjacent  green  areas  belonging  to  the  plants.  Moving  forward,  our  approach  will  embrace 
a  holistic  perspective,  encompassing  all  aspects  of  water  sourcing  and  its  efficient  utilization.  Our  ongoing  efforts  are 
reducing freshwater usage by increasing treated effluent recycling for our processes and other sanitation purposes. Efforts 
are ongoing to increase water augmentation through rainwater harvesting and recharge both within and beyond plant 
premises, as Tata Motors strives toward achieving a ‘Water Positive’ status by the year 2030.
