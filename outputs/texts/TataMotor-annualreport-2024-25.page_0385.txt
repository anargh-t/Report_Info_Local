Notes:
Tata Motors Limited (the “Company”) in October 2019 had by way of an application, addressed to the Employee Provident 
Fund Organization (“EPFO”), offered to surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the Company incurred losses for 
three consecutive years (during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling for an automatic cancellation/ withdrawal 
of pension fund exemption. On November 4, 2022, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that those who were members of 
a statutory pension fund as on September 1, 2014, can exercise a joint option with their employer to contribute to their 
Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible to draw a higher pension calculated based on last 5 years average 
salary. The Company accepted and approved the applications filed by its employees for joint option to contribute on higher 
salary on the EPFO’s portal.
As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of ₹ 165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary during 
the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however, redirected a few of such Joint Applications to the Company’s Pension Trust. 
Considering this, along with the fact that there was no positive movement towards the conclusion of the surrender process 
of the pension fund, the Company filed a Writ Petition with Hon’ble Delhi High Court (“Court”) for seeking directions to 
EPFO to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund. The trade unions have also filed another Writ Petition for 
expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and accepting the Joint Applications of the employees.
