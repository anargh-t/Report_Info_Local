improved  sustainability.  Innovations  in  material 
collection,  processing  &  recycling  technologies 
have  enabled  the  use  of  high-quality  recycled 
materials viz. polymers in dashboards and fabrics. 
These efforts align with global sustainability goals 
and EPRs reinforcing the commitment to a greener 
automotive ecosystem.

A  circular  economy  approach  is  being  embraced 
through 
and 
reusing  vehicle  components,  extending  product 
lifespans while minimizing waste. Advanced battery 
recycling programs for electric vehicles (EVs) ensure 
valuable  materials  like  lithium,  cobalt,  and  nickel 
are  recovered  and  reintegrated  into  new  battery 
production. Additionally, digital technologies, such 
as AI-driven predictive maintenance, are optimizing 
vehicle 
longevity  and  operational  efficiency, 
reducing resource consumption.

our  team  with  advanced  skills  in  software  and 
integration,  as  well  as  autonomous 
hardware 
driving  technologies,  ensuring  our  vehicles  are 
both robust and safe. 
Our  higher  education  initiatives,  such  as  the  M 
Tech programs in AI/ML, have played a vital role in 
building  future  capabilities  by  fostering  advanced 
analytical  and  machine  learning  skills.  We  are 
also  excited  about  our  company-sponsored  PhD 
program in collaboration with institutes of national 
repute,  which  aims  to  create  experts  within  our 
organization, driving innovation and research. 
FUTURE AREAS OF FOCUS:
• 
The  Company  will  continue  its  endeavor  in  R&D 
space  to  develop  technologies,  skill  set  and 
competence  which  will  help  the  Company  meet 
future  product  mix  while  meeting  the  Regulatory 
roadmap  of  the  Government  and  exceeding 
expectations of our customers.

• 
The  future  of  EV  development  will  focus  on 
advancing  technologies,  with  an  emphasis  on 
further  enhancing  energy  efficiency  and  reducing 
mechanical 
losses.  Researchers  are  dedicated 
to  refining  e-axle  systems  to  optimize  vehicle 
performance  by  minimizing  energy  consumption 
and advancing cleaner transportation solutions. 
Use  of  recycled  materials  in  commercial  vehicles 
is  becoming  increasingly  important  as  industry 
seeks to reduce its environmental impact. Recycled 
materials  offer  a  number  of  benefits,  including 
lower  production  costs  and 
reduced  waste,
