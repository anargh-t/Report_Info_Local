Building on the momentum of 
impacting over one million lives 
in the previous year, in FY25 
Tata Motors embarked on an 
audacious journey of evolving 
from location‑based approach 
to national level programme to 
achieve economies of scale to 
foster deeper engagement with the 
underserved communities.
Inspired by this tangible 
impact, Tata Motors is forging 
strategic partnerships with 
state governments, unlocking 
the potential to leverage more 
government schemes in the Company’s 
CSR programmes.
Similarly, we replicated our flagship 
IVDP in Shravasti, Uttar Pradesh — 
ranked lowest in the socio‑economic 
development indicators by NITI Aayog. 
While we continue to create 
sustainable impact in the communities 
we serve, through these new 
projects we shall reach the most 
vulnerable and untapped communities 
and geographies.
