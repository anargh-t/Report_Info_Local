1   Driving net zero
The climate crisis is no longer a distant 
risk — it is a defining reality of our 
time. FY25 has deepened our resolve 
to transform how we move people and 
goods, how we build products, and 
how we engage with the planet. As the 
world accelerates toward clean energy, 
circular systems, and climate‑resilient 
business models, Tata Motors is 
not just adapting — we are leading 
the way.
Guided by science and driven by 
purpose, we are advancing a bold 
decarbonisation journey. We remain on 
course to achieve Net Zero emissions 
by 2040 for our Passenger Vehicles 
(PV) business and by 2045 for our 
Commercial Vehicles (CV) business. 
Our commitment to RE100 continues 
to gain momentum, with a clear 
roadmap to power all operations with 
100% renewable electricity by 2030.
FY25 has been a breakthrough year 
for zero‑emission technologies. 
Hydrogen has moved from lab to road: 
we’ve initiated pilot trials of hydrogen 
internal combustion engines (H2 ICE), 
and our fuel cell electric vehicles 
(FCEVs) have now completed over a 
year of successful real‑world operation. 
These milestones complement our 
79
rapidly scaling battery electric vehicle 
(BEV) platforms, enabling us to pursue 
a multi‑path decarbonisation strategy.
We continue to lead and push the 
boundaries across our electric 
mobility portfolio:
• 
• 
• 
In Passenger Vehicles, our EVs 
have set new benchmarks 
in performance, design, 
and accessibility — making 
clean mobility aspirational 
and mainstream.
In Electric Buses, we are powering 
the backbone of public transport 
electrification in India’s major cities, 
helping reduce urban emissions 
at scale.
In Small Commercial Vehicles, 
we are unlocking clean last‑mile 
logistics with efficient, electric 
delivery and cargo solutions 
tailored to India’s needs.
Digitisation and IoT are enabling 
smarter factories and more efficient 
supply chains — optimising energy 
and other resource use across 
our operations.
We remain deeply committed to this 
journey — with integrity, innovation, 
and a bold vision for the future. 
Energy management 
Our Energy Management Programme 
is central to our sustainability 
strategy, focusing on reducing 
energy consumption and improving 
efficiency. We are consistently working 
to enhance energy performance 
through internal audits that identify 
opportunities for improvement. 
We have established clear, measurable 
targets for reducing energy use —
targets that are closely aligned with 
our broader sustainability objectives 
and reviewed regularly to ensure we 
stay on track.
Energy conservation is achieved 
through the optimised use of power 
and fossil fuels, as well as improved 
energy productivity via Energy 
Conservation (ENCON) projects. These 
initiatives are implemented across our 
plants and offices in a planned and 
budgeted manner, contributing to both 
cost reduction and climate change 
mitigation through the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions.
Crucial to this effort is identifying 
investments in new technologies 
and methods that have the potential 
to significantly reduce energy 
consumption while maintaining 
operational efficiency.
