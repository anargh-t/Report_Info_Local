Defender 
Defender continued its era of success in FY25 as one of our bestselling models. During the 
year we launched the new Defender OCTA, the most powerful and dynamic Defender ever, 
which was driven by global media for the first time to widespread acclaim. OCTA takes 
Defender into new performance and luxury territory and attracted more than 3,000 orders 
just after launch.

Jaguar 
This year marked the beginning of Castle Bromwich’s new future, producing body panels for our next‑generation 
electric vehicles and offering personalised paint options at new SV Bespoke paint facilities. This followed the 
planned end of production for the current lineup of Jaguar XE, XF, F‑TYPE, E‑PACE and I‑PACE.
Jaguar took its first public steps into this reimagined 
future with the unveiling of its new brand and the 
exuberant Type 00 design vision concept 
vehicle at Miami Art Week in December. 
Both were bold and disruptive 
moments that attracted the attention 
of over a billion people around the 
world, building excitement ahead 
of the first new Jaguar model, to be 
revealed later this year.
