Nature loss and biodiversity decline pose a strategic risk to businesses in the next decade. 
Biodiversity at our facilities
Throughout FY25, we have 
actively advanced our biodiversity 
management efforts across multiple 
sites, establishing long‑term 
ambitions to 2030 to manage 
habitats to conserve and enhance 
the biodiversity value of the land we 
manage. Activities include woodland 
management such as coppicing and 
deadwood creation, management of 
grassland and scrub, vegetation control 
in ponds and wetlands, and some areas 
where we commit to non‑intervention. 
These have been designed by 
ecologists in relation to the local 
context, and their effectiveness is 
monitored on an ongoing basis.
At our site in Itatiaia, Brazil, we 
continued our species monitoring 
project in the Itatiaia National Park in 
partnership with Onçafari and local 
park authorities. The project objectives 
are to identify the animal species found 
in the park, and to highlight those 
which are threatened, in accordance 
with the goals of the Itatiaia National 
Park Management Plan. Fifteen camera 
traps were installed, capturing 2,160 
independent records in which 33 
species could be identified.
Additionally, a final monitoring report 
was carried out for a 10,000m2 
Permanent Preservation Area with 
the condition of the area being 
restored from complete devastation 
to fully discharging the forest 
restoration commitment to the state 
environment agency.
In FY25, our Slovakia plant continued 
its commitment to environmental 
sustainability through a comprehensive 
biodiversity monitoring project in 
collaboration with the University of 
Constantine the Philosopher in Nitra. 
Since 2019, this initiative has focused 
on the inventory and population 
dynamics of various plant and animal 
species within our manufacturing site.
