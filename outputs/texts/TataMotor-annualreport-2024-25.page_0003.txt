It is with a profound sense of loss that we bid farewell to Mr. Ratan Naval Tata, 
a truly uncommon leader whose immeasurable contributions have shaped not 
only the Tata Group but also the very fabric of our nation.
For the Tata Group, Mr. Tata was more than a chairperson. He inspired by 
example. With an unwavering commitment to excellence, integrity and 
innovation, the Tata Group under his stewardship expanded its global footprint 
while always remaining true to its moral compass.
Mr. Tata’s dedication to philanthropy and the development of society has 
touched the lives of millions. From education to healthcare, his initiatives have 
left a deep‑rooted mark that will benefit generations to come. Reinforcing all of 
this mark was Mr. Tata’s genuine humility in every individual interaction. 
His legacy will continue to inspire us as we strive to uphold the principles 
he so passionately championed.
