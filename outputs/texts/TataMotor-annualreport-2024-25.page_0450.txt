5   Other Intangible assets
(a)   Accounting policy
Intangible  assets  purchased  are  measured  at  cost  or  fair  value  as  on  the  date  of  acquisition  less  accumulated 
amortisation and impairment, if any.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the intangible assets as per details below:
Technical know-how
Software
Product development cost
Estimated amortisation 
period
8 to 10 years
4 years
2 to 10 years
The amortisation period for intangible assets with finite useful lives is reviewed at each year-end. Changes in expected 
useful lives are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Internally generated intangible asset
Research costs are charged to the statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which they are incurred. 
Product development costs incurred on new vehicle platform, engines, transmission and new products are recognised 
as intangible assets, when feasibility has been established, the Company has committed technical, financial and other 
resources to complete the development and it is probable that asset will generate future economic benefits.
The cost of an internally generated intangible asset is the sum of directly attributable expenditure incurred from the 
date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria to the completion of its development.
Interest cost incurred is capitalised up to the date the asset is ready for its intended use for qualifying assets, based 
on borrowings incurred specifically for financing the asset or the weighted average rate of all other borrowings if no 
specific borrowings have been incurred for the asset.
Product  development  expenditure  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  amortisation  and  impairment,  if  any. 
Amortisation is not recorded on product engineering in progress until development is complete.
Derecognition of intangible assets
An item of intangible assets is derecognized on disposal or when fully amortized and no longer in use. Any gain or loss 
arising from derecognition of an item of intangible assets is included in the statement of profit and loss.
