aggregating to ₹196 crores as at March 31, 2025 (₹250 crores as at March 31, 2024). The reasons for disallowing credit

the local municipal authorities in respect of vacant land of the Company in the plant in Pimpri (including residential land), 
Chinchwad and Chikhali. The Company had filed Special Leave Petition (SLP) before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India 
against an unfavorable decision of the Bombay High Court. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India had disposed of the SLP 
and remanded the matter back to the local municipal corporation for fresh adjudication. After fresh hearing, the municipal

Jharkhand basis demand for earlier years. The Company believes it has a good case on merits to contest the matter and 
hence it has been disclosed as contingent liability.
Other claims
The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India (“SC”) by their order dated February 28, 2019, set out the principles based on which 
allowances paid to the employees should be identified for inclusion in basic wages for the purposes of computation of 
Provident Fund contribution. There are interpretative challenges and considerable uncertainty, including estimating the 
amount retrospectively. Pending the directions from the EPFO, the impact for past periods, if any, is not ascertainable 
reliably and consequently no financial effect has been provided for in the financial statements. The Company has complied 
with this on a prospective basis, from the date of the SC order. Also refer note 38(i) for pension.
