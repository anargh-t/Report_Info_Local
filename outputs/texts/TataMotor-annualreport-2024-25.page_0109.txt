Full-time apprentice (FTA) scheme
As part of our strategic initiative 
to build a robust talent pipeline 
for Manufacturing, Quality, and 
Service functions, we operate the 
Full‑Time Apprentice (FTA) Scheme 
under the Apprenticeship Act, 
1961. This two‑year programme 
is focused on developing skilled 
craftsmen in emerging and high‑
demand fields such as Auto Electrical 
& Electronics, Mechatronics, and 
High Voltage Systems (EV). FTAs 
are trained to become integral 
contributors to our operations, with 
future‑focused trades like Vehicle 
Software Technicians and Additive 
Manufacturing Technicians currently 
being developed in collaboration with 
government agencies.
The programme combines rigorous 
technical training at our plant‑based 
training centres, hands‑on experience 
in manufacturing environments, 
and exposure to service operations. 
A comprehensive governance 
framework ensures that apprentices 
are monitored for academic 
performance, practical skills, 
discipline, and development of soft 
skills. We currently have 216 FTAs in 
the programme, with 50% women 
(diversity) representation. Additionally, 
four out of six manufacturing locations 
have an all‑women FTA batch.
In addition to core technical expertise, 
apprentices receive training in safety, 
communication, problem‑solving, 
TQM, Kaizen, WCQ, and other 
operational excellence methodologies. 
Upon successful completion, 
top‑performers are offered roles in 
key operational functions and are 
supported by the Company’s Pragati 
higher education programme, ensuring 
continuous career growth within 
the organisation.
We have 216 FTAs in 
the programme, with 
50% representation of 
women, highlighting our 
commitment to diversity.

Utkarsha and Vidyadhan —  
Empowering the future of our 
employees’ families
As an organisation committed to 
inclusive growth and the upliftment 
of our extended workforce families, 
we launched two meaningful 
schemes — Utkarsha and Vidyadhan 
— focused on empowering the 
wards of our technician employees 
through education.
•  Under the Utkarsha programme, 
we provide scholarships for 
the daughters of technician 
employees. So far, 524 girls have 
benefitted from this initiative, 
with a total disbursement of I1.3 
crore, helping them pursue their 
academic aspirations.
•  Through the Vidyadhan 
programme, in partnership with 
the State Bank of India (SBI) the 
largest bank in India, we facilitate 
education loans at concessional 
interest rates for higher education. 
To date, I1.38 crore in loans has 
been granted to 77 students under 
this scheme.
These initiatives reflect our continued 
commitment to education, equity, 
and empowerment for our extended 
TML family.
Driving shopfloor excellence 
through self-directed teams and  
self-managed teams
•  At Tata Motors, we continue to 
nurture a culture of ownership, 
accountability, and empowerment 
on the shopfloor through the 
implementation of Self‑Directed 
Teams (SDTs) and Self‑Managed 
Teams (SMTs). These teams, 
independently run by technicians 
and contract workmen, are 
central to driving performance 
and fostering a participative work 
environment across our plants.
•  Operating with a high degree of 
autonomy, SDTs and SMTs are 
empowered to take proactive 
ownership of critical pillars such 
as Safety, Quality, Productivity, 
Delivery, Cost, Morale, and 
Environment (SQPDCME) within 
their work areas. This structure 
enables team members to identify 
opportunities, solve problems at 
the source, and take swift action 
aligned with organisational goals.
•  Beyond operational efficiency, this 
initiative significantly enhances 
engagement and collaboration 
with our business partners, 
reinforcing mutual respect, shared 
responsibility, and transparency.
•  The culture of SDTs and SMTs 
ensures that the Company’s 
Balanced Scorecard (BSC), 
objectives, and communication 
are effectively cascaded to every 
individual on the ground.
•  This bottom‑up approach 
is a cornerstone in our 
journey toward operational 
excellence, sustainable growth, 
and building a truly agile, 
empowered organisation.
To date, K1.38 crore in 
loans has been granted 
to 77 students under  
this scheme.
We continue to nurture 
a culture of ownership, 
accountability, and 
empowerment on the 
shopfloor.
