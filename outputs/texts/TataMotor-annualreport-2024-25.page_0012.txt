Chairman’s message
Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)
JLR delivered a robust financial 
performance and strong operational 
progress in FY25. 
From a financial results perspective, 
the Company delivered consolidated 
revenues of £29 billion, like the 
previous year. 
The Company achieved its aim of 
reaching an adjusted EBIT margin 
of 8.5% and recorded a positive net 
cash position at the close of the 
financial year. 
JLR continues to realise its Reimagine 
strategy this year, completing works 
to transform its UK plants for electric 
vehicle production. The ambition is 
to have electric versions of all JLR’s 
brands by the end of the decade and 
be carbon net zero by 2039. 
Sustainability:  
Core to our purpose
In alignment with the Tata Group’s 
‘Aalingana’ initiative, which focuses 
on achieving net‑zero emissions, 
fostering circular economies, and 
preserving biodiversity, your Company 
is embedding and actively advancing 
these principles across its operations.
We have set ambitious targets: 
achieving net‑zero greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2039 for JLR, 2040 for 
our passenger vehicles and by 2045 
for commercial vehicles, supported 
by interim science‑based targets 
and a commitment to sourcing 100% 
renewable electricity by 2030. 
The TATVA framework emphasises 
circularity through optimised use 
of materials, energy, and product 
lifecycles. With Re.Wi.Re (Recycle with 
Respect), we are enabling responsible 
vehicle decommissioning and 
recycling, contributing to a sustainable 
automotive lifecycle. Through our 
collaborative platform called ‘AIKYAM’, 
suppliers are being engaged to adopt 
sustainable practices across the value 
chain. Additionally, flagship biodiversity 
projects, supported by active employee 
and community participation, 
are conserving and promoting 
natural ecosystems.  
Through these concerted actions, 
Tata Motors is leading the 
automotive industry’s transition 
towards sustainable and responsible 
mobility solutions.
Demerger: A strategic leap
To empower each business to pursue 
its distinct vision, the demerger of 
Tata Motors into two listed entities — 
Commercial Vehicles and Passenger 
Vehicles (including EV and JLR) — is 
progressing as planned. Enabling
