Provision for Warranty
See Note 27 to standalone financial statements
The key audit matter
We  determined  provision  for  product  warranty  as  a  key 
audit  matter  due  to  high  estimation  uncertainty  and 
involvement of significant judgement.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
 
Tested actualization of estimated warranty provision using 
statistical sampling;
 
 
Performed  retrospective  assessment  of  provision  by 
comparing  estimated  and  actual  payments  against 
warranty claims; and
Evaluated  the  adequacy  of  disclosures  relating  to  the 
estimation of Product warranty provisions.
Other Information
The  Company’s  Management  and  Board  of  Directors  are 
responsible for the other information. The other information 
comprises  the  information  included  in  the  annual  report, 
but  does  not  include  the  financial  statements  and  auditor’s 
report  thereon.  The  annual  report  is  expected  to  be  made

Our opinion on the standalone financial statements does not 
cover the other information and we will not express any form 
of assurance conclusion thereon.
In  connection  with  our  audit  of  the  standalone  financial 
statements, our responsibility is to read the other information 
identified  above  when  it  becomes  available  and,  in  doing 
so,  consider  whether  the  other  information  is  materially 
inconsistent with the standalone financial statements or our 
knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be 
materially misstated.
When  we  read  the  annnual  report,  if  we  conclude  that 
there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to 
communicate the matter to those charged with governance 
and take necessary actions, as applicable under the relevant 
laws and regulations.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the 
Standalone Financial Statements
Our  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance  about 
whether  the  standalone  financial  statements  as  a  whole 
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud 
or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor’s  report  that  includes  our 
opinion.  Reasonable  assurance  is  a  high  level  of  assurance, 
but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance 
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it 
exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are 
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they 
could  reasonably  be  expected  to  influence  the  economic
