The  performance  of  all  management  staff  employees  is  managed  through  a  performance  appraisal  process  called 
LOOP.  The  performance  management  process  facilitates  open  communication  between  managers  and  employees  to 
clarify expectations, communicate organizational goals, provide feedback, and offer continuous coaching for improving 
performance. This system employs a structured cascade of balanced scorecard objectives (at Business Unit level) all the 
way  down  to  individual  targets,  ensuring  alignment  across  the  organization.  It  integrates  performance  and  leadership 
behavior appraisal, with rewards based on both company performance and individual contributions. Compensation reviews 
consider performance, leadership behavior, and market comparisons, ultimately aiming to enhance business outcomes by 
defining and achieving goals effectively.
