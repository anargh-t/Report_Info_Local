Technology and innovation 
Driving a customer‑first transformation while modernising Enterprise Digital 
Capabilities were the focal points of the year gone by. Technology and innovation 
will power a future‑ready enterprise that is efficient, intelligent, and deeply 
customer‑centric.
Customer experience: 
personalised, predictive, and 
connected
Customer‑centricity remains at the 
heart of Tata Motors’ innovation 
journey. Through the deployment 
of intelligent digital solutions, we 
are enhancing vehicle ownership 
experience from pre‑purchase 
engagement to post‑sale service.
Generative AI‑powered solutions 
were deployed to enrich customer 
experience. An advanced email 
responder was introduced to manage 
new customer complaint emails, 
generating over 22,000 personalised, 
policy‑compliant responses. Trained on 
historical interactions and enterprise 
knowledge, the system reduced 
average response time from ~3 hours 
to under 5 minutes – ensuring real‑time 
resolution, enhanced consistency, and 
service excellence at scale. Another 
Gen AI solution delivered real‑time, 
policy‑compliant responses to investor 
queries during the sensitive Tata 
Technologies IPO window and during 
the conversion of TML DVR shares. 
Focused enhancements in service 
quality and customer support, 
achieved a 25% reduction in customer 
service station revisits and a 15% 
decline in complaints per thousand 
vehicles – reinforcing our drive 
towards service excellence and 
customer delight. 
A first‑in‑industry C75 drive cycle was 
introduced for EV range prediction. 
Built on synthesised data from 4 billion 
kilometres of actual EV usage and 
calibrated to individual driving styles 
and terrain conditions, it delivered 
highly accurate range estimates. 
Introduced as part of our Curvv.ev 
launch in August 2024, this innovation 
was instrumental in improving 
consumer trust, reducing range 
anxiety, and accelerating EV adoption.
To boost charging infrastructure, 
we operationalised an AI‑based 
Geo‑Spatial Analytics model to 
optimise fast‑charger deployment. 
Factoring in traffic density, usage 
patterns, and infrastructure gaps, 
the tool facilitated a 10% increase 
in fast charging network coverage 
year‑over‑year. As of FY25, 85% of 
national highways and 73% of state 
highways are now within 50 km of a 
fast charger, while metro cities offer 
a charging station every 5–7 km, 
improving EV convenience.
In our vehicle logistics operations 
spanning 400+ dealers across 
India, a mobile‑first Proof of 
Delivery solution‑integrated with 
our Transporter Portal and Dealer 
Management System — has digitised 
last‑mile vehicle deliveries. This has 
enhanced transparency, enabled 
real‑time tracking, and eliminated 
manual reconciliation, ensuring 
a seamless handover experience 
for customers.
We reached 1 million Connected 
Commercial vehicles during the year. 
This expanding ecosystem enables 
us to deliver personalised contextual 
recommendations, over‑the‑air 
updates, and intelligent alerts for 
predictive maintenance, besides 
usage‑based promotions, enriching 
the ownership journey and fostering 
brand affinity.
Through these initiatives, 
Tata Motors is driving the transition 
to experience‑led mobility, merging 
technological innovation with 
human‑centred design to create 
enduring customer value.
