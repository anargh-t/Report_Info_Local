Fair Value Hierarchy
The  following  table  provides  an  analysis  of  financial  instruments  that  are  measured  subsequent  to  initial 
recognition at fair value, grouped into Level 1 to Level 3, as described below.
Quoted  prices  in  an  active  market  (Level  1):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  instruments    that  are 
measured  by  reference  to  quoted  prices  (unadjusted)  in  active  markets  for  identical  assets  or  liabilities.  This 
category consists of quoted equity shares, quoted corporate debt instruments and mutual fund investments.
Valuation  techniques  with  observable  inputs  (Level  2):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial  assets  and 
liabilities, measured using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e; as prices) or indirectly (i.e; derived from prices). This level of hierarchy include 
Company’s over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts.
Valuation  techniques  with  significant  unobservable  inputs  (Level  3):  This  level  of  hierarchy  includes  financial 
assets and liabilities measured using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
Fair values are determined in whole or in part, using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither 
supported by prices from observable current market transactions in the same instrument nor are they based on 
available market data.
