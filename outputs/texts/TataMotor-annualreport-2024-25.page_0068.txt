Investor and shareholder centricity
Tata Motors considers its investors and shareholders as an integral part of its business 
eco‑system. Our continuous communication with the shareholders keeps them abreast of 
not only the financial performance and business operations of the Company but also the 
regulatory requirements concerning them from time to time. Shareholders are encouraged to 
express their concerns, queries, complaints, if any, and are provided with the resolutions / 
redressal thereof within a reasonable time. We value the feedback of our investors and 
shareholders to continuously improve our disclosures norms and transparency on financial 
and non‑financial parameters.
