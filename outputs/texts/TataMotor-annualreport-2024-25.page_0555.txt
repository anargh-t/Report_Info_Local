TML  has  a  contract  manufacturing  arrangement 
(CMA)  with  FIAPL  for  manufacture  of  engines  and 
vehicles.  The  manufacturing  capacity  available  will 
be shared between TML and FCA based on volume 
commitment given by each party. Going forward, the 
Company’s  capacity  entitlement  for  manufacturing 
Tata vehicles shall be apportioned between TMPVL 
and TPEML on mutually agreed basis.
TMPVL  sells  castings  and  aggregates  of  engines, 
metal  bodies,  etc  to  the  Company.  The  Company 
then  assembles  engines,  transaxles  and  fitment 
of  other  peripheral  parts  to  build  the  powertrain 
which  is  sold  to  FIAPL.  FIAPL  uses  the  powertrain 
to manufacture vehicles which is eventually sold to 
TMPVL. 
The  aforementioned  transactions  would  not  only 
help  both  the  Companies  to  manage  its  business 
operations  smoothly  but  would  also  ensure  a 
consistent  flow  of  desired  quality  and  quantity  of 
various facilities for uninterrupted operations and an 
increase in productivity. This in turn will contribute 
towards Tata Motors’ group synergy.
TMPVL  also  purchases  vehicle  spare  parts  and 
components  from  FIAPL.  FIAPL  has  undertaken  to 
reserve certain production capacity of its Ranjangaon 
Manufacturing  Facility 
for  manufacturing  and 
supplying of motor vehicles and related spare parts.

The existing principles of cost allocation, take 
or pay arrangement and true up mechanism 
(including  for  expenses  and  mechanism  for 
adjustments)  as  defined  in  CMA  will  apply 
between  TMPVL  and  TPEML  on  mutually 
agreed  basis.  Considering  there  would  be 
flexibility to use each other’s capacities even 
as  the  year  progresses,  this  would  bring  in 
better  operational  efficiency  for  TPEML  as 
well as TMPVL.
The aforementioned transactions would not
