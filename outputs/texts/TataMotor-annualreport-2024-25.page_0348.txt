Deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  measured  based  on  the  tax  rates  that  are  expected  to  apply  in  the  period 
when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there 
is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income 
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Company intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on 
a net basis. The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on an assessment of the probability 
that future taxable income will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and tax loss carry-
forwards can be utilised.
Deferred  tax  liabilities  on  taxable  temporary  differences  arising  from  investments  in  subsidiaries,  branches  and 
associated companies and interests in joint arrangements are not recognised if the Company is able to control the 
timing of the reversal and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
