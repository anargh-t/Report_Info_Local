26.  Overview of the entity’s material responsible business conduct issues:
Please indicate material responsible business conduct and sustainability issues pertaining to environmental and 
social matters that present a risk or an opportunity to your business, rationale for identifying the same, approach 
to adapt or mitigate the risk along-with its financial implications, as per the following format:
At Tata Motors, we acknowledge the role of materiality assessments in ensuring that our ESG efforts are relevant, 
strategic,  and  impactful.  This  year  marks  a  significant  milestone  for  TML  as  we  have  broadened  our  approach  to 
materiality assessments by incorporating the concept of double materiality for the first time.
The Double Materiality Assessment (‘DMA’) has helped us determine which sustainability issues are most important 
to both the organization and its stakeholders. It involves evaluating the impact of the organization on environmental 
and  social  factors  (inside-out  perspective)  and  examining  how  these  factors  affect  the  organization  (outside-
in  perspective).  This  dual  approach  helps  the  company  identify  and  prioritize  ESG  issues  that  are  both  financially 
important and socially impactful, promoting the comprehensive integration of sustainability into its core strategy.
