(d)  Financial risk management
In  the  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  is  exposed  primarily  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange 
rates,  interest  rates,  equity  prices,  liquidity  and  credit  risk,  which  may  adversely  impact  the  fair  value  of  its 
financial instruments.
The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks 
associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management 
policy is approved by the board of directors. The risk management framework aims to:
l 
Create  a  stable  business  planning  environment  by  reducing  the  impact  of  currency  and  interest  rate

liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with 
reasonable accuracy.
(a)  Foreign exchange currency rate risk:
 The  fluctuation  in  foreign  currency  exchange  rates  may  have  potential  impact  on  the  consolidated 
statement of profit and loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated balance

any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are denominated in a 
currency other than the functional currency of the respective consolidated entities.
Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations are 
subject  to  risks  arising  from  fluctuations  in  exchange  rates  in  those  countries.  The  risks  primarily  relate
