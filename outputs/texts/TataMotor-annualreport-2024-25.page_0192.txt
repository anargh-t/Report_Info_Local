Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
Tata Motors is cognizant of 
the physical and transition 
risks posed by climate 
change in the short, medium 
and long term. We have set 
ourselves ambitious targets 
of achieving Net Zero GHG 
emissions by 2045 in CV 
business, and 2040 in the 
PV business. We have set 
intermediate targets of 
achieving RE100 before the 
end of this decade and are 
committed to set interim 
Science Based Targets.
Our roadmap, at the 
operations level, and 
product level, are fully 
aligned to our ambition and 
our intermediate targets.
As part of its 
decarbonization strategy, 
TML will set renewable 
energy standards for its 
suppliers and collaborate 
with them to ensure these 
are adaptable and cost-
effective.
Own Operations: 
Energy use in 
manufacturing contributes 
to Scope 1 and Scope 2 
greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. Transitioning 
to renewable energy 
presents a strategic 
opportunity to mitigate 
emissions, and enhance 
long-term cost efficiency. 
In alignment with our 
RE100 commitment, this 
opportunity supports our 
decarbonization roadmap 
while strengthening 
business resilience and 
aligning with global 
expectations on climate 
action and sustainable 
growth.
Downstream (Long term): 
Emissions from internal 
combustion engine (ICE) 
vehicles play a major role in 
contributing to greenhouse 
gases and climate change. 
TML adheres to CAFÉ 
regulations. Transitioning 
to low-emission vehicles 
offers TML growth 
potential and supports 
its climate mitigation 
initiatives.
Own Operations: (Medium 
term)
High energy consumption 
will result in higher 
emissions in manufacturing 
processes in addition to 
higher resource depletion.
Upstream (Short term): 
Increased energy usage by 
supply chain partners will 
lead to elevated emissions, 
Suppliers may need to 
shift to renewable energy 
sources to lower emissions, 
which could affect their 
operational expenses. 
Variations in energy costs, 
particularly for renewable 
sources, can influence 
supplier pricing and the 
overall cost framework. 
Collaborating with suppliers 
to support them in 
transitioning to renewable 
energy presents a significant 
opportunity for TML.
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Positive Implications:
This opportunity is 
anticipated to positively 
impact TML’s finances, 
driven by potential market 
prospects for low-emission 
vehicles.
Although investing in 
renewable energy projects 
requires substantial initial 
funding, the long-term 
financial gains and strategic 
benefits can surpass these 
costs, bolstering TML’s 
financial stability and 
sustainability objectives.
Negative Implications:
Regulatory non-
compliance related to 
emission standards can 
have significant legal, 
financial, and reputational 
consequences for 
companies.
Negative Implications:
This risk is expected 
to negatively impact 
TML’s finances due to 
increasing supplier costs, 
which will affect TML’s 
overall expenses.
Rising and unpredictable 
energy costs, along with 
investments in renewables 
and facility upgrades, 
can strain profits in the 
short term.
Positive Implications:
This opportunity is 
anticipated to positively 
influence TML’s financial 
performance. Renewable 
energy sources, such as 
solar or wind, can reduce 
the volatility associated with 
fossil fuel prices, leading 
to more predictable and 
potentially lower supply 
chain costs.
