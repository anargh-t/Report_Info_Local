Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net 
investment in the leases. Finance income is allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant periodic rate of 
return on the Company’s net investment outstanding in respect of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial 
direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased 
asset and recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 
(b)  The Company leases a number of buildings, plant and equipment, IT hardware and software assets, certain of which 
have  a  renewal  and/or  purchase  option  in  the  normal  course  of  the  business.  Extension  and  termination  options 
are included in a number of leases across the Company. The majority of extension and termination options held are 
exercisable only by the Company and not by the respective lessor. The Company assesses at lease commencement 
whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the extension or termination option. The Company re-assesses whether 
it is reasonably certain to exercise options if there is a significant event or significant change in circumstances within 
its control. It is recognised that there is potential for lease term assumptions to change in the future and this will 
continue to be monitored by the Company where relevant. The Company’s leases mature between 2026 and 2037. 
The weighted average rate applied is 8.37% (2024: 8.57%).
