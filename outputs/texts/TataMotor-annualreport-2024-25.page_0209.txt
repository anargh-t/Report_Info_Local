3.  Accessibility  of  workplaces:  Are  the  premises  /  offices  of  the  entity  accessible  to  differently  abled  employees  and 
workers, as per the requirements of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016? If not, whether any steps are 
being taken by the entity in this regard.
Tata Motors recognizes the importance of fostering an inclusive environment where Persons with Disabilities (PWD) are 
not just accommodated but actively empowered. As part of our commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI), we 
are embarking on a strategic initiative to integrate differently abled employees candidates seamlessly into our workforce. 
This  strategy  employs  a  multifaceted  approach,  encompassing  proactive  audits,  civil  works  enhancements,  along  with 
parallel comprehensive sensitization programs.
This approach ensures that our efforts are comprehensive and holistic, leaving no stone unturned in creating an environment 
conducive to the success of differently abled employees candidates.
Proactive Audits: We are in the process of conducting various accessibility audits of infrastructure and buildings to identify 
barriers  and  areas  for  improvement  in  accommodating  differently  abled  employees  candidates.  These  audits  will  be 
conducted in collaboration with experts in accessibility and disability rights, ensuring compliance with relevant regulations 
and standards like the Harmonized Guidelines and Standards for Universal Accessibility in India - 2021, released by the 
Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.
Civil Works Enhancements: We will initiate civil works enhancements aimed at eliminating physical barriers and creating 
accessible spaces for differently abled employees candidates. This includes, but is not limited to, installing ramps, accessible 
restroom facilities, tactile markers, and ergonomic workstations—ensuring that our workplaces are truly inclusive.
Comprehensive  Sensitization  Programs:  We  understand  that  creating  an  inclusive  environment  goes  beyond  physical 
accommodations;  it  requires  a  shift  in  mindset  and  cultural  norms.  Therefore,  we  will  continue  conducting  workshops 
called  ONEderful  Conversations  that  help  comprehend  the  various  defined  DEI  aspects.  These  half-day  workshop  are 
specially curated and delivered by trained facilitators from the diverse business domains to drive the agenda to the last 
level employee. The program is aimed at raising awareness, dispelling myths, and fostering empathy among employees.
Underlining  Message  of  Inclusivity:  Throughout  our  DEI  communication,  we  will  underline  the  message  of  inclusivity, 
emphasizing our intent to create an environment where every individual, regardless of ability, feels valued and respected. 
Our communication is long-term focused and highlights the intent behind our actions—underscoring our commitment to 
diversity and inclusion as one of our foundational beliefs.
Readiness  for  Visitors  and  Employees:  In  addition  to  catering  to  our  employees,  we  will  ensure  that  our  facilities  are 
equally  accessible  and  accommodating  for  visitors,  including  clients,  partners,  and  stakeholders.  This  ensures  that  our 
commitment to inclusivity is evident not only within our workforce but also in our interactions with external parties. We 
are in the process of building a uniform experience across locations.
