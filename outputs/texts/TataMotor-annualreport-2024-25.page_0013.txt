corporate actions to streamline the 
capital structure of the Company and 
enhance its operational focus gathered 
pace during the year with the successful 
delisting of its DVRs and the merger 
of Tata Motors Finance Ltd. with 
Tata Capital Ltd. In early FY26, your 
Company’s shareholders approved 
the demerger which is expected to 
be effective during the second half 
of 2025, with shareholders receiving 
equivalent shares in both entities.
The proposed demerger, will bring 
greater strategic clarity and agility, 
enabling a more focused approach to 
execution and value creation, delivering 
superior experiences for customers, 
rewarding careers for employees, and 
long‑term returns for shareholders.
Looking ahead
We step into FY26 with confidence in 
our strategy, strength in our execution, 
and belief in our people. We remain 
vigilant to worldwide volatility, 
including the impact of changes 
in global trade conditions and the 
varying degrees of adoption of electric 
vehicles across different markets and 
evolving technologies, to accelerate 
our production plans while delivering 
value to our customers. I remain 
confident in the future of our brands 
and the resilience of our business. Our 
focus remains on delivering consistent 
growth, enriching customer experience, 
and innovating for a cleaner, safer, and 
more connected mobility future.
The commitment of our people and 
our partners during the year cannot be 
overstated. They continued to deliver 
the highest standards of care and 
innovation for our clients, as well as for 
our communities and the environment. 
I would like to thank our teams for 
their efforts and our partners for 
their support.
On behalf of the Board, I thank you for 
your continued trust and partnership. 
Together, we are moving purposefully 
towards a better tomorrow.
Warm Regards,
N Chandrasekaran
