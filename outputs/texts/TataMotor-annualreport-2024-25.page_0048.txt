Range Rover
The continued growth and success of the Range Rover brand is 
confirmed by growth in wholesales for Range Rover and Range 
Rover Sport by 8.9% and 19.7%, respectively, with the brand 
seeing some of the highest loyalty and client repurchase rates.
Range Rover took major strides towards launching its first 
pure‑electric model with a waiting list at 59,867. Meanwhile, our 
engineers tested Range Rover Electric to the extremes, to ensure 
it delivers as a true Range Rover experience.

Discovery
This year, we celebrated 35 years of the iconic Discovery. 
Over the years, Discovery has introduced new levels of luxury 
and comfort, from leather interiors to Air Suspension as 
standard and now, seamless connectivity for all three rows of 
the family. For a decade, the Discovery Sport has maintained 
a reputation for versatility, with seven stadium seats all 
packaged in a footprint no larger than a five‑seat vehicle. More 
recently, the Discovery Sport was updated with a minimalist 
interior featuring the latest technology and connectivity, and 
it was made available as a plug‑in hybrid, combining luxury, 
adaptability and sustainability.
