Sustainability  
and ESG focus
A resilient business strategy ensures 
long‑term success by anticipating risks, 
adapting to changes, and leveraging 
opportunities. All the business verticals 
of the Company are well placed 
with a focus on evolving customer 
preferences and value creation for the 
end customer. 
Electrification and digital 
transformation are revolutionising 
the automotive industry by enhancing 
vehicle efficiency, connectivity, and 
sustainability. These advancements 
drive innovation, improve user 
experiences, and support a 
greener future.
The commercial vehicle business 
aspires to deliver profitable growth 
with reduced volatility along with 
exploring new opportunities across 
the value chain. We introduced ‘Better 
Always’, the new mantra embodying 
our steadfast commitment to all 
stakeholders of continuous growth. 
The passenger vehicle business 
is resilient and holding the market 
share along with market leadership in 
the EV industry. We plan to increase 
the addressable market by introducing 
new nameplates, strengthen the 
multi‑powertrain strategy to leverage 
industry powertrain shifts and leverage 
technology to augment our products in 
line with customer demands.
JLR has shifted to luxury, embodied 
by four distinct House of Brands with 
the creation of bespoke products and 
special editions to increase desirability. 
Better supplier relationships, greater 
visibility of the global supply chain, and 
in‑house control over the creation of 
key components will remain focus area.
The commercial and passenger 
vehicle industry in India is rapidly 
embracing digitisation to enhance 
efficiency, reduce costs, and improve 
customer experience. Connected 
vehicle platforms are enabling real‑time 
diagnostics and telematics, offering 
fleet operators greater control over 
vehicle health and performance. 
There is a growing shift toward 
digital sales channels and financing 
platforms, making the purchase and 
ownership experience more seamless 
and accessible. 
JLR built an award‑winning intelligent 
automation, artificial intelligence (AI) 
and data capability that has driven a 
real impact for the business. One of 
the key enablers in delivering JLR’s 
Reimagine strategy is the introduction 
of SAP S/4HANA, a cloud‑based 
enterprise management system, to 
JLR’s manufacturing plants.
A focus on sustainability and ESG 
principles drives responsible business 
practices. It enhances long‑term value, 
mitigates risks, and fosters positive 
societal impact, ensuring ethical 
operations and resilience in a rapidly 
changing world.
The domestic vehicle industry in India 
is placing strong emphasis on ESG 
goals. Manufacturers are adopting 
strategies aimed at achieving net zero 
emissions, water neutrality, and zero 
waste to landfill. Vehicle scrappage 
initiatives are gaining momentum, 
encouraging the removal of older, 
polluting vehicles from roads and 
promoting cleaner alternatives. 
These measures reflect a growing 
industry‑wide commitment to 
sustainable growth, ensuring that 
economic progress goes hand in hand 
with environmental stewardship and 
long‑term resilience.
JLR successfully completed trials with 
Novelis using a new aluminium skin 
alloy that’s up to 85% recycled and 
up to 95% more energy efficient to 
produce. Also, JLR X Pirelli FSC‑Certified 
rubber tyres are to be rolled out across 
all future vehicles starting with the 
Range Rover Electric.
