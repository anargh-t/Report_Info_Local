the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Positive implications:
This opportunity is expected 
to positively impact TML’s 
finances as a result of new 
revenue opportunities.
This opportunity is 
projected to positively 
impact TML’s finances. 
It can create additional 
revenue streams by 
selling byproducts or 
recycled materials to other 
industries. TML can also 
reduce the costs associated 
with raw material 
procurement. Utilizing 
recycled materials often 
costs less than purchasing 
new ones, leading to 
direct savings.
Circular sourcing result in 
streamlined operations 
and lower production 
costs, enhancing overall 
profitability. Using recycled 
materials typically incurs 
lower expenses.
Rationale for identifying 
the risk / opportunity
In case of risk, approach to 
adapt or mitigate
-
Own Operations (Long 
term): 
 The increasing regulations 
on resource use and waste 
management can have 
significant implications 
for TML. Streamlining 
manufacturing processes 
presents an opportunity 
for TML to reduce resource 
outflows and waste. 
 High demand can lead to 
fluctuating raw material 
prices, causing financial 
uncertainty and increased 
costs, which in turn can 
affect profit margins. 
Environmental impacts 
of resource use might 
prompt stricter government 
regulations on consumption. 
By adopting circular 
economy principles, like 
recycling and reusing 
materials in manufacturing, 
TML can reduce resource 
use and waste. 
Downstream (Medium 
term): Vehicles are 
composed of various 
valuable materials. Failure 
to properly recycle these 
materials means they are 
lost to landfills instead of 
being recovered. Circular 
business models are 
designed to minimize waste 
and maximize resource 
efficiency by keeping 
products, materials, and 
resources in use for as long 
as possible.
Upstream (Long term): 
Rising demand for finite 
resources can lead to 
scarcity and heightened 
competition, disrupting 
supply chains. By exploring 
the opportunity of 
adopting sustainable 
sourcing strategies, 
TML can minimize 
environmental impacts 
and maintain supply chain 
stability. Additionally, 
developing robust vehicle 
recycling and refurbishing 
services can enhance 
sustainability and reduce 
dependence on virgin 
materials.
