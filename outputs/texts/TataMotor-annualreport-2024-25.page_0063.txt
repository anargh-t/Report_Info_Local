Tata Motors’ continues enduring commitment to future‑readiness by embedding AI, data 
science, and automation into the heart of our operations, we are creating a more agile, 
resilient, and value‑driven enterprise one that is equipped to lead the mobility revolution 
in an increasingly AI driven world.
Data & AI: Driving an 
intelligent, agile enterprise
FY25 was a year of creating a strong 
enterprise Infrastructure & Data fabric 
to scale the deployment of AI across 
critical business functions, enabling 
real‑time insights, automation, 
and agility.
A hybrid private cloud with advanced 
voice analytics emerged as a powerful 
agent for sales conversion. Processing 
over 1,50,000 recorded conversations 
in multiple languages, our AI engine 
categorised leads based on intent 
and sentiment. More than 55,000 
high‑potential leads were surfaced 
and prioritised, significantly improving 
sales response times and boosting 
conversion efficiency.
In engineering, AI transformed 
traditional product development. 
Predictive models simulate real‑world 
vehicle behaviour, enabling us to 
optimise powertrain configurations, 
improve fuel efficiency, and accelerate 
design validation. These simulations 
have reduced reliance on physical 
testing, delivering substantial time 
and cost savings while enhancing 
engineering precision.
Our N=1 pricing strategies, dynamically 
tailored discounts and incentives based 
on customer behaviour and market 
context to enhance competitiveness, 
enable sales conversions and 
improve realisation.
Together, these initiatives reflect 
our commitment to embedding 
data intelligence into the core of 
our decision‑making processes. 
By transforming data into actionable 
insight, Tata Motors is building a 
responsive, agile enterprise equipped 
for dynamic market environments.

Software defined 
manufacturing: building 
intelligent, sustainable plants
Tata Motors is reimagining 
manufacturing with a focus on digital 
orchestration, intelligent automation, 
and sustainable efficiency. In FY25, 
we expanded the adoption of 
Industry 4.0 technologies across our 
production facilities. The commercial 
vehicle business unit has initiated 
adoption of SAP S/4HANA to establish 
a future‑ready, digitally native 
ERP platform.
Advanced computer vision and 
machine learning systems are deployed 
on the shop floor to proactively 
identify quality deviations across 
painting, casting, and assembly 
processes. Predictive analytics tools 
monitor sealant gaps, paint thickness, 
and structural welds, ensuring superior 
first‑time‑right outcomes.
Safety has been bolstered through 
real‑time video analytics that detect 
PPE non‑compliance, restricted 
zone access, and operator fatigue. 
These AI‑led interventions have 
strengthened shopfloor safety 
governance across all plants.
In our Paint shops, a dynamic AI‑based 
time prediction model has optimised 
oven startup durations based on daily 
load profiles. Besides yielding 7% 
energy savings, it reduced operating 
costs besides contributing to our 
sustainability targets.
Our digital supply chain ecosystem now 
connects more than 2,000 suppliers 
across five manufacturing locations. 
AI‑powered forecasting tools and 
performance dashboards ensure 
real‑time material visibility and smart 
inventory planning. Digitisation of 15 
warehouses and over 100 line‑side 
marts supports Just‑in‑Time (JIT) 
and Just‑in‑Sequence (JIS) inventory 
management, improving throughput 
and reducing working capital. 
A mobile‑based Digital Control Tower 
with real‑time visibility of production 
KPIs enables faster decisions.
Through the convergence of 
automation, AI, and digital 
systems, Tata Motors is 
shaping the next generation of 
manufacturing‑sustainable, adaptive 
and digitally enabled.
