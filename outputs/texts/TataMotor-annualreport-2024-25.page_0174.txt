A.  CONSERVATION OF ENERGY
The  Company  has  always  been  conscious  of  the  need 
to  conserve  energy  in  its  Manufacturing  Plants  which 
leads to optimized consumption of non-renewable fossil 
fuels,  energy  productivity,  climate  change  mitigation, 
and reduction in operational costs. The Company is also 
signatory to RE100 - a collaborative, global initiative of 
influential  businesses  committed  to  100%  renewable 
electricity,  and  is  working  to  increase  the  amount  of 
renewable  energy  generated  in-house  and  procured 
from off-site sources. 
(i) 
steps

 The 
conservation of energy:
(ENCON)  projects  have 
Energy  Conservation 
been implemented at all Plants and Offices of the 
Company in a planned and budgeted manner. Some 
of the major ENCON projects in FY25 include::
Optimization of compressed air consumption 
at the Foundry, resulting in significant energy 
savings and reduction in CO2 emissions.
Elimination  of  the  Sealer  Oven  process 
in  the  Paint  Shop,  leading  to  substantial 
energy conservation.
Implementation  of  Variable  Refrigerant  Flow 
(VRF)  systems  in  the  Engine  Assembly  and 
Power Train areas to enhance energy efficiency.

various 
These  ENCON  efforts  in  FY25  have  resulted  into 
energy  savings  of  44.1  lakh  kWh  electricity  and 
12908 GJ of fuel, resulting into avoided emission of 
3978 tCO2.
(ii)    The  steps  taken  by  the  Company  for 
utilizing alternate sources of energy:
The Company continued to add on-site Renewable 
Energy  (solar)  generation  capacity  in  FY25,  which 
brings the total installed capacity to 55.5 MWp:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pimpri (Pune): 18.5 MWp
Chinchwad (Pune): 2.4 MWp
Jamshedpur: 11.5 MWp
Pantnagar: 16 MWp
Lucknow: 6.1 MWp
Dharwad: 1 MWp
The  Company  also  sources  off-site  renewable 
energy through Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) 
with  Third  Party  Wind  &  Solar  Power  Generators 
and  Green  Energy  Purchase  from  Exchange  & 
Discom  and 
(international  renewable 
energy certificates).
I-REC’s 
The  Company  plans  to  continue  to  source  off-site 
renewable power in line with regulatory policies / 
frameworks  and  tariffs  in  the  States  where  we 
operate. These efforts will continue to help offset 
greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. 
In  FY25  the  Company  generated  /  sourced  
148  million  kWh  of  renewable  electricity  for  its 
manufacturing operations, which amounts to 45% 
of the total power consumption for the Commercial 
Vehicle  operations.  This  contributed  to  avoidance 
1.07 lakh tonnes of CO₂ .
Eliminated  sealer  baking  process  on  paint 
shop by implementation of wet-on-wet sealer 
Paint Shop to reduce propane consumption
Heat  Pump  utilization  for  Paint  shop  Process 
tank heating.
Digitization  and  furnace  optimization  in  heat 
treatment area.
Energy  efficient  HVLS  fans  installation  at 
various assembly lines.
(iii)   The 
capital 
investment  on 
energy 
conservation equipment:
In FY25, the Company has invested ₹1.68 crore in 
various energy conservation projects.
