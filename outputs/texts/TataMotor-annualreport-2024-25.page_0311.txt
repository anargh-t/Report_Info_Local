Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with 
Reference to Financial Statements
A  company’s 
internal  financial  controls  with  reference 
to  financial  statements  is  a  process  designed  to  provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  the  reliability  of  financial 
reporting  and  the  preparation  of  financial  statements  for 
external  purposes  in  accordance  with  generally  accepted 
accounting  principles.  A  company’s 
internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements include those 
policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of  records  that,  in  reasonable  detail,  accurately  and  fairly 
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the 
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions 
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial 
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company 
are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with  authorisations  of 
management and directors of the company; and (3) provide 
reasonable  assurance  regarding  prevention  or  timely 
detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of 
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the 
financial statements.
Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial 
Controls with Reference to Financial 
Statements
Because  of  the  inherent  limitations  of  internal  financial 
controls with reference to financial statements, including the 
possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management  override 
of  controls,  material  misstatements  due  to  error  or  fraud 
may  occur  and  not  be  detected.  Also,  projections  of  any 
evaluation of the internal financial controls with reference to 
financial statements to future periods are subject to the risk 
that the internal financial controls with reference to financial 
statements  may  become  inadequate  because  of  changes  in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate.
Other Matters
Our aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the 
adequacy and operating effectiveness of the internal financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements/financial 
information insofar as it relates to two subsidiary companies, 
one step-down subsidiary company and one joint operation 
company,  which  are  companies  incorporated  in  India,  is 
based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such 
companies incorporated in India.
The  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to  financial 
statements/financial  information  insofar  as  it  relates  to 
one  subsidiary  company,  three  associate  companies  and 
one  associate  company  of  a  subsidiary  company,  which 
are  companies  incorporated  in  India  and  included  in  these 
consolidated  financial  statements,  have  not  been  audited 
either by us or by other auditors. In our opinion and according 
to  the  information  and  explanations  given  to  us  by  the 
Management, such unaudited subsidiary company, associate 
companies  and  one  associate  company  of  a  subsidiary 
company are not material to the Holding Company.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.
