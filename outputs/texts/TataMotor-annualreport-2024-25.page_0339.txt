JLR  considers  the  variable  profit  and  volumes  assumptions  to  be  interdependent  as  movement  in  one  assumption  will 
impact the other, impacting the overall variable profit. For example, the profit optimisation efforts discussed above will 
likely result in higher average variable profit per unit with lower volumes whereas a focus on volumes would likely see 
a  reduction  in  the  average  variable  profit  per  unit.  Consequently,  the  terminal  value  variable  profit  sensitivity  below 
incorporates sensitivity in volumes via the impact on variable profit.
The table below shows the amount by which the value assigned to the key assumptions must change for the recoverable 
amount of the CGU to be equal to its carrying amount, none of which are considered to be reasonably plausible:
Forecast period (Yr1-5) variable profit
Pre-tax discount rate
Terminal value variable profit (%GVR)
Terminal value capital expenditures (%GVR)
