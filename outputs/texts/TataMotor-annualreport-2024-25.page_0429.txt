(b)  According to the information and explanations given 
to us and based on the audit procedures conducted 
by us, in our opinion the investments made during 
the year and the terms and conditions of the grant 
of  loans,  secured  or  unsecured,  advances  in  the 
nature  of  loans,  and  guarantees  given  during  the 
year are, prima facie, not prejudicial to the interest 
of  the  Company.  The  Company  has  not  provided 
any securities during the year.
(c)  According  to  the  information  and  explanations 
given to us and on the basis of our examination of 
the  records  of  the  Company,  in  the  case  of  loans 
given,  in  our  opinion  the  repayment  of  principal 
and  payment  of  interest  has  been  stipulated  and 
the  receipts  have  been  regular  except  in  case  of 
two wholly-owned subsidiaries outside India where 
cumulative principal amount of Rs. 619 crores and 
cumulative interest amount of Rs. 191 crores which 
was due for repayment in earlier years has not been 
collected as at 31 March 2025, since management 
believes  that  these  amounts  are  not  recoverable 
as these subsidiaries are in losses and the amounts 
have been provided for in the financial statements 
of  the  Company.  Further,  loans  amounting  to 
Rs.  3,033  crores  have  been  given  to  another  four 
wholly  owned  subsidiaries  which  is  repayable  on 
demand. As informed to us, the Company has not 
demanded repayment of the loans during the year. 
Thus,  there  has  been  no  default  on  the  part  of 
the party to whom the money has been lent. The 
payment of interest has been regular. Further, the 
Company has given advance in the nature of loans 
to two suppliers as mentioned below:
