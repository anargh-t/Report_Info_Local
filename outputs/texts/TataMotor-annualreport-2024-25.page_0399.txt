to fluctuations in U.S. dollar, GBP, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Singapore dollar and Euro, against the 
respective functional currencies of Tata Motors Limited and its subsidiaries.
The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments 
primarily  to  hedge  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  exposure.  Furthermore,  any  movement  in  the 
functional currencies of the various operations of the Company against major foreign currencies may impact 
the  Company’s  revenues  and  expenditure  relating  to  its  international  operations.  Any  weakening  of  the 
functional currency may impact the Company’s cost of imports and cost of borrowings and consequently 
may increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.
The  Company  evaluates  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  assessing  its  exposure  to 
exchange rate risks.
The  foreign  exchange  rate  sensitivity  is  calculated  for  each  currency  by  aggregation  of  the  net  foreign 
exchange rate exposure of a currency and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the foreign 
exchange rates of each currency by 10% while keeping the other variables as constant. 
The following analysis is based on the gross exposure as of the relevant balance sheet dates, which could 
affect  the  income  statement.  There  is  no  exposure  to  the  income  statement  on  account  of  translation 
of financial statements of consolidated foreign entities. Furthermore, the exposure as indicated below is 
mitigated by natural hedges resulting from anticipated revenue and cost in foreign currency expected to 
arise in future as  well as certain derivative contracts entered into by the Company.
