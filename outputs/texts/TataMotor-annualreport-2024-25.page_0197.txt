the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Positive Implications:  
TML is recognized by 
consumers for the 
superior safety ratings of 
its vehicles. There is an 
opportunity to build on its 
brand perception and offer 
enhanced safety features 
to consumers, improving 
market share.
Negative Implications: This 
risk could adversely affect 
TML, as non-compliance 
might result in fines, and in 
severe cases, prosecution 
and temporary suspension 
of operations.
Reputation damage and 
consumer backlash can 
affect sales and market 
share.
TML has established 
systems and processes, 
such as audits and due 
diligence, to ensure 
compliance. The Company 
also conducts regular 
training sessions for its 
employees on topics 
related to bribery, 
corruption, and other 
ethical issues.
TML provides training 
for dealers via online 
modules upon their 
joining. Additionally, audits 
and unannounced visits 
are conducted to ensure 
compliance.
TML provides transparent 
reports on its ESG 
initiatives and performance 
to build trust with 
stakeholders and showcase 
its commitment and 
accountability.
Positive and Negative 
Implications: Responsible 
investment can lead to 
positive impacts due to 
enhanced reputation and 
investor attractiveness. On 
the other hand, investment 
in non-aligned ESG areas 
can lead to reputational 
damage and reduced brand 
loyalty.

Own Operations (Long 
term): If whistle-blower 
concerns are not properly 
addressed, TML may 
face regulatory, legal, 
and reputational risks, 
potentially resulting in 
scandals. Legal penalties 
can be incurred in 
situations involving 
corruption, bribery, insider 
trading, and other ethical 
violations.
Downstream (Long term): 
Unethical practices within 
dealership and service 
networks can expose TML 
to significant regulatory 
and legal risks, which can 
have serious repercussions 
on its operations and 
reputation. This can lead 
to consumer backlash 
and a shift in customer 
preferences away from 
TML.
Own Operations 
(Medium term): ESG 
issues in investments 
can pose significant 
financial risks. Failing to 
consider ESG factors in 
investment decisions can 
damage a Company’s 
reputation. In today’s 
market, stakeholders 
are increasingly valuing 
sustainability, and 
negative perceptions can 
lead to reduced brand 
loyalty and decreased 
competitiveness.
Integration of responsible 
investment practices 
enhances the organization’s 
reputation and can attract 
value-aligned investors and 
clients.
