functioning,  efficacy  of  communication  with  stakeholders, 
inputs  received  from  all  the  Directors,  etc.  The  NRC  has 
also  reviewed  the  performance  of  the  Individual  Directors 
based on their knowledge, level of preparation and effective 
participation  in  meetings,  understanding  of  their  role  as  a 
Director, etc.
Please  refer  to  the  paragraph  on  Board  Evaluation  in  the 
Board’s Report for detailed analysis.
Board  Diversity:  To  ensure  that  a  transparent  Board 
nomination  process  is  in  place,  that  encourages  diversity 
of  thought,  experience,  knowledge,  perspective,  age  and 
gender, the Board has adopted a Diversity Policy, formulated 
by  the  NRC,  wherein  it  is  stated  that  the  Board  has  an 
appropriate  blend  of  functional  and  industry  expertise.  
As on March 31, 2025, our nine member Board of Directors, 
consisted  of  one  ED,  one  NINED  and  seven  IDs,  out  of 
which  three  were  Women  IDs.  Whilst  recommending  the 
appointment of a Director, the NRC considers the manner in 
which, the function  and  domain  expertise of the individual, 
could contribute to the overall skill-domain mix of the Board 
and is supported by the Tata Group Human Resource Function 
in this regard.
Key  Board  Skills,  Expertise  and  Competencies:  As  on  
March 31, 2025, the Board comprised of qualified members 
who bring in the required skills, competence and expertise to 
enable them to effectively contribute in deliberations at Board 
and  Committee  Meetings.  The  below  matrix  summarizes 
a  mix  of  skills,  expertise  and  competencies  expected  to  be
