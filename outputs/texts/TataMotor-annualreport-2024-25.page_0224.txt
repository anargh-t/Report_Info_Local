In one of the instances, 15 workers bonded at Math Village in Ahilya Nagar District, who had passed through the hands 
of four owners since October 2024, were exploited, provided with inadequate food and water, and kept under unhygienic 
conditions, nearly forbidden to return home. With the help of the District Magistrateâ€™s Office, efforts were made by our 
team to reach their relatives, and all the workers were rescued and sent back to their homes in HOL village in Jalgaon in 
March 2025. It was also ensured that all their dues were paid.
