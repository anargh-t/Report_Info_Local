Advancing supply chain 
sustainability roadmap
We have taken a holistic approach 
to embed sustainability in our 
supply chain. Our Sustainable Supply 
Chain Framework is driven by a clear 
ambition to align our supply chain 
with broader sustainability goals, 
setting measurable targets and 
encouraging supplier collaboration. 
Strong governance through ethical 
policies and a robust Supplier Code 
of Conduct ensures integrity and 
risk mitigation. 
Sustainability is integrated across 
the supplier lifecycle via rigorous 
assessments through a digital portal. 
The initiative is powered by Aikyam, 
a platform that unites stakeholders 
through knowledge sharing and 
impactful lighthouse projects 
focused on renewable energy, water 
conservation, waste reduction, and 
circular economy practices. 
Reducing embodied emissions
By adopting the principles of 
circular economy, we are focusing 
on reducing embodied emissions in 
our materials.
Reimagining the  
supply chain (JLR)
JLR’s ‘Reimagine’ strategy directly 
addresses supply chain challenges 
by fostering collaboration with 
suppliers. Through knowledge 
sharing and co‑creation initiatives,
JLR aims to accelerate the transition 
towards a sustainable future 
throughout our entire value chain.
Upscaling renewable  
energy usage
Our strategy tackles emissions 
through a 100% renewable electricity 
transition, energy conservation, and 
phasing out fossil fuels in logistics. 
We are making significant progress 
on renewables and conservation to 
achieve a greener future. All operations 
will be RE‑100 by 2030.
