People  
and culture
We are dedicated to 
cultivating a culture of 
continuous learning — one

collaboration, and capability‑
building. We provide 
opportunities for exploration 
and empower our people to 
boldly pursue new paths, both 
personally and professionally. 
As the organisation evolves in 
a dynamic global landscape, 
we strive to attract world‑class 
talent while nurturing a high‑
performance environment 
where contributions are 
valued and growth is earned. 
Enhancing the overall 
employee experience remains 
central to our people strategy,

recognised and rewarded.

Employee Culture Survey 2025
•  For the past four years, we have consistently conducted the Employee Culture 
Survey to give our people a voice in shaping our culture. In February 2025, we 
achieved our highest‑ever participation rate of 91%, surpassing the industry 
benchmark of 86% — a strong testament to the trust employees place in 
the process. 
•  While the overall engagement score held steady at 70%, our Change 
Management score rose by 4% to 77%, reflecting tangible progress. These 
results highlight that employees are not only more aware of the Culture Credo 
but are also seeing and feeling the impact of our collective cultural journey.
