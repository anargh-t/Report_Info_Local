As at March 31, 2025, the schemes held Gilt Repos. The net value of these transactions is included in the value of 
government bonds in the table above. The value of the funding obligation for the Repo transactions is ₹ 10,683 crores 
as at March 31, 2025 (2024: ₹ 7,331  crores).
JLR assigns an accounting level (1, 2 or 3) to asset holdings in order to reflect the level of judgement involved in the 
valuation of an asset. In assigning the level JLR balances consistency between asset holdings, consistency from year 
to year and manager/other assessments. JLR designates level 1 to direct holdings of liquid assets where an active 
market exists.
Custodian accounts where underlying assets are regularly traded or where comparable assets have traded values 
are designated level 2, for example derivatives (including net value of swaps) and some property holdings. Assets 
which are not designated as level 1 or 2 are designated as level 3. Level 1 assets are reported as quoted, level 2 and 3 
unquoted. Repo obligations are noted separately.
Private  Equity  holdings  have  been  measured  using  the  most  recent  valuations,  adjusted  for  cash  and  currency 
movements between the last valuation date and March 31, 2025. Given the movements in listed equity markets, the 
valuation of Private Equity holdings may vary significantly. The value of the Private Equity holdings in the JLR UK Plans 
included above is ₹ 13,284 crores as at March 31, 2025  (2024:  ₹ 7,184 crores).
The sensitivity analysis below is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In 
practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the 
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same methods (present value of 
the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has 
been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the consolidated balance sheet.
The  methods  and  types  of  assumptions  used  in  preparing  the  sensitivity  analysis  did  not  change  compared  to 
previous periods.

In June 2023, the High Court handed down a decision in the case of Virgin Media Limited v NTL Pension Trustees II 
Limited and others relating to the validity of certain historical pension changes due to the lack of actuarial confirmation 
required by law. In July 2024, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal brought by Virgin Media Ltd against aspects of 
the June 2023 decision. The conclusions reached by the court in this case may have implications for other UK defined 
benefit plans including JLR schemes. The Company and pension trustees are currently considering the implications of 
the case for the JLR UK defined benefit schemes. The defined benefit obligation has been calculated on the basis of 
the pension benefits currently being administered, and at this stage the directors do not consider it necessary to make 
any adjustments as a result of the Virgin Media case, however as further information emerges over the coming year 
JLR will review whether and to what extent there are changes in its liabilities
JLR has taken legal advice considering the documentation of the UK schemes and the regulatory environment. This 
confirmed the recoverability of any surplus in the scheme via reduced future contributions or settlement and JLR has 
based its accounting judgement on this advice.
The average duration of the benefit obligation at March 31, 2025 is 12.8 years (2024: 14.2 years).
The expected net periodic pension cost for the year ended March 31, 2026 is expected to be ₹ 476 crores. JLR expects 
to pay ₹ 399 crores to its defined benefit schemes, in total, for the year ended March 31, 2026.
Defined contribution plan
The Company’s contribution to defined contribution plans aggregated ₹ 1,919 crores and ₹ 1,708  crores for years 
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.
