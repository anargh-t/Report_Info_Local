Provident  Fund  Organization  (“EPFO”),  offered  to 
surrender its exempted Pension fund. Subsequently, the 
Company  incurred  losses  for  three  consecutive  years 
(during FY 2019-20, 2020-21 & 2021-22), thereby calling 
for  an  automatic  cancellation/  withdrawal  of  pension 
fund exemption.
On  November  4,  2022,  the  Hon’ble  Supreme  Court 
ruled  that  those  who  were  members  of  a  statutory 
pension  fund  as  on  September  1,  2014,  can  exercise  a 
joint  option  with  their  employer  to  contribute  to  their 
Pension fund beyond the statutory limit and be eligible 
to draw a higher pension calculated based on last 5 years 
average  salary.  The  Company  accepted  and  approved 
the applications filed by its employees for joint option to 
contribute on higher salary on the EPFO’s portal.
As per the actuarial valuation, an additional provision of 
₹165 crores have been made for pension on higher salary 
during the year ended March 31, 2025. EPFO, however, 
redirected  a  few  of  such  Joint  Applications  to  the 
Company’s  Pension  Trust.  Considering  this,  along  with 
the fact that there was no positive movement towards 
the conclusion of the surrender process of the pension 
fund,  the  Company  filed  a  Writ  Petition  with  Hon’ble 
Delhi High Court (“Court”) for seeking directions to EPFO 
to immediately start administering TML’s Pension Fund. 
The  trade  unions  have  also  filed  another  Writ  Petition 
for expediting the transfer of pension fund corpus and 
accepting the Joint Applications of the employees.
EPFO in December 2024, sent a recommendation to the 
Government of India for cancellation of the Company’s 
pension  exemption,  subject  to  fulfilment  of  certain 
conditions.  The  parties  had  series  of  meetings  to 
channelize  the  migration  of  members  data  to  EPFO’s 
unified  portal,  prominently  the  joint  meetings  in  April 
2025,  of  which  the  duly  signed  minutes  were  filed  in 
the Court on May 1, 2025. It has been agreed in the said 
minutes that EPFO will provide a facility on the Unified 
Portal  for the Company to  migrate the members’ data 
on EPFO’s portal. The Company will start contribution in 
statutory pension fund w.e.f. wage month of July 2025. 
Pension  Trust  will  transfer  the  liability  towards  normal 
pension valuation carried by EPFO. The Court took the 
above minutes on its records and fixed the matter on July 
23,  2025  for  implementation  of  same  as  per  timelines 
agreed in the minutes.

investees 
In  FY25,  our  share  of  equity-accounted

subsidiaries was decreased to ₹319 crores in FY25 from 
₹408  crores  in  FY24.  The  non-controlling  interest  has 
reduced,  due  to  merger  of  TMFL  with  TCL,  interest  on 
perpetual debt. This has been partially offset by increase 
in non-controlling interest of Tata Technologies Ltd, due 
to sale of stake by TML during FY24.
Profit after tax:
Our consolidated net profit in FY25, excluding shares of 
non-controlling interests, is ₹27,830 crores, as compared
