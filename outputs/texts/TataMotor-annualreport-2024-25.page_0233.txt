this indicator.
* Non-hazardous waste disposed in lots have been converted into Metric tonnes using an average conversion factor from the generated value in 
FY 25 due to an improvement in tracking processes leading to a marginal increase in the waste footprint reported.
 **The intensity adjusted for PPP has been restated following the guidelines set forth in SEBI’s circular dated December 20, 2024, which outlines 
Industry  Standards  Forum  guidance  for  BRSR  Core.  The  PPP  factor  has  been  sourced  from  IMF  database.  https://www.imf.org/external/
datamapper/PPPEX@WEO/OEMDC.
*** Includes non-hazardous ferrous and non-ferrous metal and other scrap like packaging waste, plastic, rubber, glass and auto components that 
were sold to scrap dealers and not to the primary recyclers. Recycling data has been certified through declarations by scrap dealers who in turn 
sell to end-users who are secondary metallurgical industries or recyclers that convert scrap into other products.
$ Does not include non-hazardous waste, plastic waste and scrap disposal that were recorded in lots or numbers.
10.  Briefly describe the waste management practices adopted in your establishments. Describe the strategy adopted by 
your  company  to  reduce  usage  of  hazardous  and  toxic  chemicals  in  your  products  and  processes  and  the  practices 
adopted to manage such wastes.
The waste generated from our operations is categorized into hazardous and non-hazardous, as well as recyclable and non-
recyclable types. Our waste management practices are governed by the Consent Orders and hazardous waste authorizations 
provided by the respective State Pollution Control Boards in the areas where we operate. We are committed to promoting 
cleaner production, waste minimization, and pollution prevention initiatives. Additionally, we focus on the principles of the 
circular economy, including reuse and recycling, while ensuring full compliance with all relevant legal requirements.
We have also looked at innovative ways of reducing the moisture content of the ETP sludge through the installation of 
sludge drying bed. The drying process takes place in an enclosed shed, where the floor bed is heated by circulating hot 
water heated through Concentrated Solar Thermal to effectively remove moisture from the sludge. It is estimated that 
around 30% of the ETP sludge disposal quantity will be reduced through the effective drying process.
We are committed to reducing the use of hazardous and toxic chemicals in our manufacturing processes. This is achieved
