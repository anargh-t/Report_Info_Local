Moderation in growth rates
 After three years of robust post‑Covid 
expansion, FY25 marked a phase 
of growth moderation for the PV 
industry, aligned with broader trends 
in domestic consumption. The industry 
registered wholesales of 4.3 million 
units, reflecting a modest 2% growth 
over FY24. While OEMs maintained 
a strong wholesale push, customer 
demand remained subdued, leading 
to a highly competitive, discount‑
driven environment.
Sustained segmental shift
towards SUVs
 In FY25, SUVs continued to be the 
growth engine for the industry, with 
double‑digit growth for the segment, 
pushing the salience to an all‑time high 
of 55%. In contrast, hatchback and 
sedan segments saw a steep decline 
of 12‑13% over the previous year. This 
segmental shift has been driven by 
evolving customer preference towards 
larger, feature‑rich and practical 
SUVs, coupled with a strong pipeline 
of new launches concentrated in the 
SUV segment.
Strong growth in CNG segment
The industry also saw strong 
momentum in fuel‑type transitions, 
with CNG vehicles registering ~35% 
growth versus FY24. This has been 
driven by rising personal segment 
traction for CNGs due to expanding 
CNG infrastructure, rising customer 
awareness and the introduction 
of models offering features and 
performance on par with other ICE 
counterparts. This surge has elevated 
CNG to the second‑largest fuel 
category, accounting for more than 
18% of new PV sales.
