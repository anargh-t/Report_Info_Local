Downstream
Expand EV portfolio
A majority of our downstream 
emissions are attributed to the  
use‑phase of our products.
We are committed to decarbonising 
both systematically and systemically 
— through continuous efficiency 
improvements, the adoption of 
alternative fuel powertrains such 
as CNG, LNG, and Flex‑Fuel, and by 
advancing destination technologies 
including Battery Electric Vehicles and 
Green Hydrogen‑powered solutions, 
including Internal Combustion Engines 
and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles.

Increasing renewable 
energy usage (JLR)
Our global renewable energy 
strategy focuses on increasing 
self‑generated power to exceed 
35% of global consumption 
by 2030. This approach 
reduces reliance on the local 
grid and minimises the need 
for purchased grid‑based 
renewable energy.

Channel partner sustainability
To drive sustainability across our 
dealer network, we have developed 
the Channel Partner Sustainability 
Programme, equipping partners with 
structured frameworks, digital tools, 
and best practices to integrate ESG 
principles into their operations. This 
initiative ensures that sustainability 
is embedded in every aspect of 
their business, from environmental 
stewardship and resource efficiency 
to ethical governance and 
social responsibility.
To support this effort, a Sustainability 
Guidance Handbook has been 
created as a comprehensive roadmap 
for channel partners to align with 
Tata Motors’ Aalingana sustainability 
objectives. The handbook offers 
structured guidelines for ESG 
implementation, highlighting 
best practices in environmental 
management, social impact, and 
corporate governance, along with 
clear directives to help enhance 
sustainability performance.
Decarbonising together: 
Partnering for progress
In the collective pursuit of net zero 
emissions, JLR is committed to a 
two‑pronged approach. We are 
actively electrifying our product 
portfolio, while simultaneously 
collaborating with our downstream 
value chain to decarbonise the supply 
of key materials. Through SBTi targets, 
we aim for a significant reduction  
of 60% in downstream emissions per 
vehicle kilometre across the entire use 
phase of our vehicles.
