Lab 116 provides essential computational resources, access to the DGX server, and 
a conducive research environment necessary for our project and research work. 
We  also  request  that  all  lab  amenities  and  resources  be  made  available  during  these

1.  Proper management and security of the lab during off-hours. 
2.  Registration of entry and exit times for all students utilizing the lab, to ensure 
accountability and safety. 
We  assure  you  that  all  students  will  strictly  adhere  to  university  rules,  maintain 
discipline, and handle all lab facilities responsibly. 
A  list  of  students  requesting  extended  access  is  attached  herewith,  along  with  the
