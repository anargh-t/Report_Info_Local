Auditor’s Responsibility
Our  responsibility  is  to  express  an  opinion  on  the  internal 
financial controls with reference to financial statements based 
on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the 
Guidance  Note  and  the  Standards  on  Auditing,  prescribed 
under  Section  143(10)  of  the  Act,  to  the  extent  applicable 
to  an  audit  of  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to 
financial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note 
require  that  we  comply  with  ethical  requirements  and  plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether adequate internal financial controls with reference 
to financial statements were established and maintained and 
if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our  audit  involves  performing  procedures  to  obtain  audit 
evidence  about  the  adequacy  of  the  internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  and  their 
operating  effectiveness.  Our  audit  of 
internal  financial 
controls  with  reference  to  financial  statements  included 
obtaining  an  understanding  of  internal  financial  controls 
with  reference  to  financial  statements,  assessing  the  risk 
that  a  material  weakness  exists,  and  testing  and  evaluating 
the  design  and  operating  effectiveness  of  internal  control 
based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the 
risks  of  material  misstatement  of  the  consolidated  financial 
statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the 
audit evidence obtained by the other auditors of the relevant 
subsidiary  companies,  associate  companies,  joint  venture 
companies  and  joint  operation  companies  in  terms  of  their 
reports  referred  to  in  the  Other  Matters  paragraph  below, 
is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit 
opinion  on  the  internal  financial  controls  with  reference  to 
financial statements.
