Furthermore,  the  IEPF  Rules  mandate  companies  to  transfer  shares  of  shareholders  whose  dividend  amounts  remain 
unpaid/unclaimed for a period of 7 consecutive years to the demat account of the IEPF Authority. The said requirement 
does not apply to shares in respect of which there is a specific order of the Court, Tribunal or Statutory Authority, restraining 
any transfer of shares.

The Board of Directors, at its meeting held on July 25, 2023, approved (subject to, inter alia, obtaining the regulatory and 
other approvals including from the Hon’ble NCLT a Scheme of Arrangement (‘Scheme’) for reduction, through cancellation 
of the entire ‘A’ Ordinary Share capital and in consideration thereof, issue and allotment of New Ordinary Shares in the 
Company, in the manner as contemplated in the Scheme.
The Hon’ble NCLT vide Order dated August 2, 2024 sanctioned the Scheme which was effective from September 1, 2024. 
Accordingly, the Company cancelled 50,85,02,896 ‘A’ Ordinary shares of ₹2.00 each (₹102 crore) and issued and allotted 
35,59,52,028 New Ordinary Shares of ₹2.00 each (₹71 crore) to TML Securities Trust, in terms of the Scheme. TML Securities 
Trust was able to credit New ordinary Shares to the respective ‘A’ Ordinary shareholders, except 173,389 New Ordinary 
Shares.  Of  these  86,411  New  Ordinary  Shares,  have  been  transferred  to  Investors  Education  and  Protection  Fund  on  
March 13, 2025.
Since  the  extinguished  and  cancelled  ‘A’  Ordinary  Shares  under  the  Scheme  included  the  ‘A’  Ordinary  Shares  already 
transferred to IEPFA, the Company had requested the IEPFA for a waiver from transferring the corresponding New Ordinary 
Shares  to  IEPFA  and,  instead,  proposed  to  credit  the  same  directly  into  the  Demat  account  of  the  eligible  ‘A’  Ordinary 
Shareholders. This was initiated in order to avoid repetition of the process of reclaiming the New Ordinary Shares by these 
shareholders from IEPFA. While the IEPFA acknowledged the issue, the Company could not obtain the requisite waiver from 
IEPFA in the absence of any specific legislations in this regard. In view of the above, the Company transferred the requisite 
number of New Ordinary Shares and amount in cash to the designated accounts of the IEPFA before March 31, 2025.  
Whilst  the  Company  and/  or  it’s  RTA  send  out  communication’s  to  the  Members,  Debenture  holders  and  Depositors 
informing them about the due dates to transfer the unclaimed dividends/interest payments to IEPF, the attention of the 
concerned stakeholders is again drawn to this matter through the Annual Report. The data on unpaid/unclaimed dividend 
amounts  and  other  unclaimed  monies  is  also  available  on  the  Company’s  website  at  https://www.tatamotors.com/
unclaimed-dividend/.  Investors who have not yet encashed their unclaimed/unpaid amounts are requested to correspond 
with the Company’s RTA, at the earliest. Members may refer to the Procedure for claiming the aforementioned amounts 
transferred to the IEPFA as detailed on http://www.iepf.gov.in/IEPF/refund.html.
The Members who have a claim on the above dividend amounts and shares and other unclaimed monies may apply for 
refund of the same from the IEPFA by following the procedure prescribed under IEPF Rules, 2016, as amended from time 
to time.
Primarily, the concerned shareholder must submit the requisite documents and obtain the Entitlement Letter from the 
Company. Thereafter, an online application in web-Form IEPF-5, as available on the website of the Ministry of Corporate 
Affairs  www.mca.gov.in,  should  be  filed  and  the  said  form  duly  self-certified  should  be  forwarded  to  the  Company  for 
furnish the E-Verification Report, in the prescribed format, to the IEPFA. No claims shall lie against the Company in respect 
of the dividend/shares so transferred. The Members/Claimants can file only one consolidated claim in a financial year as 
per the IEPF Rules.
