  Transfer of financial assets
The  Company  transfers  finance  receivables  through  securitisation  transactions  and  direct  assignments.  In  such 
transactions the Company surrenders control over the receivables, though it continues to act as an agent for the collection 
of receivables. Generally in such transactions, the Company also provides credit enhancements to the transferee.
Because  of  the  existence  of  credit  enhancements  in  such  transactions,  the  Company  continues  to  have  the 
obligation to pay to the transferee, limited to the extent of credit enhancement provided, even if it does not 
collect the equivalent amounts from the original asset and hence continues to retain substantially all risks and 
rewards associated with the receivables, and as a result of which such transfer or assignment does not meet the 
derecognition criteria, resulting in the transfer not being recorded as sale. Consequently, the proceeds received 
from such transfers are recorded as collateralized debt obligations.
