(Indicate positive or

Upstream (Medium term): 
Human Rights-related 
issues in any tier of the 
supply chain can pose 
reputation and regulatory 
risks for TML and its 
suppliers. If Human rights 
concerns are not properly 
addressed, suppliers may 
face regulatory, legal, 
and reputational risks, 
potentially affecting their 
operations and in turn, 
business continuity at TML.
TML periodically seeks 
Human rights-related 
information from suppliers. 
The company encourages 
suppliers to create 
mechanisms for affected 
individuals to report 
human rights violations 
and create systems to 
detect and resolve the 
issues in a time-bound 
manner.
Negative implications: 
This risk is anticipated to 
negatively impact TML. 
Suppliers’ failure to ensure 
human rights for their 
employees and workers 
will negatively impact on 
TML’s reputation, and in 
extreme cases, limit the 
suppliers’ ability to provide 
services to TML, affecting 
business continuity.
