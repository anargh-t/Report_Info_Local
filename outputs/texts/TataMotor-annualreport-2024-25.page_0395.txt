There have been no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 for the year ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
Valuation of Compulsorily Convertible Preference Share (CCPS) classified as financial liability is carried out by the 
management using combination of Monte Carlo simulation approach which is a statistical technique that is used 
to simulate equity value of Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited and projected Cashflow discounted using 
risk free interest rate prevailing on the date of valuation. Since significant unobservable inputs are applied in 
measuring the fair value, financial liability is classified in Level 3.

Other short-term financial assets and liabilities are stated at amortized cost which is approximately equal to their 
fair value.
The fair value of  finance  receivables  has  been estimated by  discounting  expected  cash flows using rates at 
which loans of similar credit quality and maturity would  be  made and  internal  assumptions  such as  expected 
credit  losses  and  estimated  collateral  value  for  repossessed  vehicles  as  at  March  31,  2025  and  2024.  Since 
significant unobservable  inputs  are  applied in measuring the fair value, finance receivables are classified in 
Level 3. 
The fair value of borrowings which have a quoted market price in an active market is based on its market price 
and  for other borrowings the fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash flows, using a discount 
rate  equivalent  to    the  risk-free  rate  of  return,  adjusted  for  the  credit  spread  considered  by  the  lenders  for 
instruments of similar maturity and credit quality.
Management uses its best judgment in  estimating the  fair value  of  its  financial  instruments.  However,  there  
are  inherent limitations in any estimation technique. Therefore, for substantially all financial instruments, the fair 
value estimates presented above are not necessarily indicative of all the amounts that the Company could have 
realized or paid  in sale  transactions  as of respective dates. As such, the fair  value  of  the  financial  instruments  
subsequent  to  the  respective  reporting dates may be different from the amounts reported at each period end.
 Offsetting
Certain  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities  are  subject  to  offsetting  where  there  is  currently  a  legally 
enforceable right to set off recognized amounts and the Company intends to either settle on a net basis, or to 
realise the asset and settle the liability, simultaneously.
