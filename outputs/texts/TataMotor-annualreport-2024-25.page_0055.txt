Opportunities
Transition to electrification 
Jaguar has been reimagined as an 
all‑electric luxury brand embodied 
by its Type 00 design vision concept, 
which debuted at Miami Art Week in 
December 2024. The first reimagined 
production car will be the most 
powerful Jaguar ever, with a range of 
c. 700 kilometres. 
The Range Rover Electric has 
undergone rigorous testing in the 
year and nears its testing completion 
programme prior to its launch later this 
year. The vehicle’s capabilities surpass 
any other luxury electric SUV, and over 
59,867 clients signed up to the waiting 
list as at 31 March 2025. 
JLR and Chery are forging an innovative 
collaboration model that epitomises 
our growth path for the future through 
the licensing of Freelander. The blend 
of Chery’s advanced EV technology 
with the distinctive appeal of the 
Freelander brand will provide China 
and global consumers with a unique 
electric vehicle experience. 
Our shift to electrification is central 
to transforming our business and to 
achieving carbon net zero by 2039. 
We aim to offer electric versions of all 
of our brands by the end of the decade.
Execution of Reimagine 
During the year, we announced a £500 
million investment to transform our 
historic Halewood facility to support 
the parallel production of electric 
vehicles, alongside existing combustion 
and hybrid models, before eventually 
becoming our first all‑electric 
production facility. This is part of an 
£18 billion investment as we transition 
to our luxury electric‑first future. 
In addition, we invested £65 million 
in the expansion of paint facilities to 
meet increasing client demand for 
bespoke vehicle personalisation across 
our brands. 
Strong Leadership and 
utilisation of the Tata 
Ecosystem 
Throughout the year, we have 
strengthened our leadership 
team to support the next phase 
of our Reimagine transformation. 
Our empowering leadership drives 
our commitment to quality decision‑
making and strategic success. 
Also, our partnerships with 
Tata Group strengthened as we 
continue to leverage synergies 
within the Tata Ecosystem. In Q3, 
we announced our plan to partner 
with Tata Communications (TCL), 
using its MOVE™ platform on our 
next‑generation vehicles to enable 
continuous connectivity in the 
remotest locations from 2026.
