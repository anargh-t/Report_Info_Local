New Paths 
Newer Aspirations
At Tata Motors, we are stepping into a new era — one defined by 
sharper focus, greater agility, and bold ambition.
Our forthcoming demerger marks a pivotal transformation: forming two 
independent, publicly listed companies — one dedicated to personal 
mobility, including Passenger Vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover, and the 
other focused on commercial mobility solutions.
This move enables each entity to pursue distinct strategies, drive 
purposeful innovation, and respond swiftly to evolving market dynamics. 
With dedicated leadership and a clear strategic mandate, both 
businesses are better positioned to strengthen market presence, unlock 
new growth opportunities, and deliver sustained value while continuing 
our legacy of safety, reliability, and sustainability.
For our stakeholders, this evolution is more than a structural change 
— it is a reaffirmation of our commitment to long‑term value creation, 
deeper customer trust, and shaping the future of mobility.
As we chart new paths, we do so with renewed 
aspirations — to lead with clarity, perform with excellence, 
and deliver a safer, smarter, and greener tomorrow.
