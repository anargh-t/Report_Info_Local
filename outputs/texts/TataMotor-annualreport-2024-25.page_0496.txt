The  Company  evaluates  the  impact  of  foreign  exchange  rate  fluctuations  by  assessing  its  exposure  to 
exchange rate risks. It hedges a part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in accordance 
with its risk management policies.
The  foreign  exchange  rate  sensitivity  is  calculated  for  each  currency  by  aggregation  of  the  net  foreign 
exchange rate exposure of  each currency and a simultaneous parallel foreign exchange rates shift in the 
foreign exchange rates of each currency by 10% while keeping the other variables as constant.
The  exposure  as  indicated  below  is  mitigated  by  some  of  the  derivative  contracts  entered  into  by  the 
Company as disclosed in (iv) derivative financial instruments and risk management below.

(b)  Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will lead to changes in fair value of financial 
instruments or changes in interest income, expense and cash flows of the Company.
The  Company  is  subject  to  variable  interest  rates  on  some  of  its  interest  bearing  liabilities.  The  Company’s 
interest  rate  exposure  is  mainly  related  to  debt  obligations.  The  Company  also  uses  a  mix  of  interest  rate 
sensitive financial instruments to manage the liquidity and fund requirements for its day to day operations like 
short term loans.
As at March 31, 2025 and 2024, financial liabilities of ₹1,175 crores and ₹3,783 crores, respectively, were subject 
to variable interest rates. Increase/decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates at the balance sheet date would 
result in decrease/increase in profit before tax of ₹12 crores and ₹38 crores for the year ended March 31, 2025 
and 2024, respectively.
