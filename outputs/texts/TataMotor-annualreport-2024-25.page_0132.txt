Carbon net zero by 2039
Our decarbonisation is underpinned by our ambition to be carbon net zero 
by 2039, through the decarbonisation of our manufacturing and operations, 
our supply chain and our vehicles in use, and is supported by our mid‑term 
science‑based targets in 2030.
Circular economy and resource efficiency
The resources we use and consume play a pivotal role in the environmental 
impact of our supply chain, operations and products in use. Our pathway to net 
zero requires us to embrace the circular economy to help ensure that we reduce 
our impact whilst creating value and making our supply chain more resilient.
Nature and biodiversity
Nature loss and biodiversity decline pose a strategic risk to businesses in the 
next decade.
