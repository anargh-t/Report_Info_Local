Yes, KPMG Assurance and Consulting 
Services LLP has provided reasonable 
assurance on data reported under 
this indicator.
*The numbers for FY 24 have been restated due to reclassification of green attribute ownership for renewable electricity and enhanced coverage 
of fuel consumption points. 
**The intensity adjusted for PPP has been restated following the guidelines set forth in SEBI’s circular dated December 20, 2024, which outlines 
Industry  Standards  Forum  guidance  for  BRSR  Core.  The  PPP  factor  has  been  sourced  from  IMF  database.    https://www.imf.org/external/

2.  Does the entity have any sites / facilities identified as designated consumers (DCs) under the Performance, Achieve and 
Trade (PAT) Scheme of the Government of India? If Yes, disclose whether targets set under the PAT scheme have been 
achieved. In case targets have not been achieved, provide the remedial action taken.
Not Applicable
