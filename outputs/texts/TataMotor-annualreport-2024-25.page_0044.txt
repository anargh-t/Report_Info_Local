Renewed Momentum for EV
industry in H2 FY25
 While the first half of FY25 saw 
subdued EV demand due to negative 
global sentiment and the expiry of 
certain incentives, the second half 
of the year marked a strong revival. 
New product launches by major OEMs 
and a growing charging network 
have renewed consumer interest and 
confidence in EVs. These collective 
efforts have reinvigorated the EV 
ecosystem, setting the stage for 
sustained growth and reaffirming the 
long‑term potential of electric mobility 
in India.
Slowdown in fleet segment,
followed by recovery
 The EV fleet segment experienced 
a sharp 30% decline in registrations 
in FY25, following the expiry of the 
FAME II incentive, which affected 
demand for fleets. There had also 
been a pre‑buying surge in March 
2024, which triggered a subsequent 
slowdown in purchases in the 
following months. This temporary 
dip impacted overall fleet demand 
during the initial quarters. However, 
signs of recovery have emerged in Q4 
FY25, supported by improved market 
sentiment and growth in the employee 
transportation segment.
Expanding charging  
ecosystem
 India’s EV charging infrastructure is 
growing rapidly, with over 21,000 
public chargers now installed across 
the country. A key highlight has been 
the widening of charging coverage 
along national highways, significantly 
enhancing customer confidence in 
long‑distance and intercity travel. 
This progress is being driven by 
government support and open 
collaboration by Tata Motors.
