mechanism for any other stakeholders 
of the Company, including communities, 
to approach the Ethics Counsellor, Apex 
Ethics Committee, Chairperson of the 
Audit Committee of the Company, or other 
channels set out in this Policy, to report 
violations of the Code of Conduct or any

Additionally, our organization has established 
dedicated forums at various levels to ensure 
the effective handling of grievances related to 
our valued workmen. These forums—namely 
the Joint Shop Council (JSC), Joint Divisional 
Council (JDC), and Joint Management Council 
(JMC)—are strategically located at the Shop, 
Division, and Plant levels, respectively. These 
forums serve as platforms where workmen 
can table their grievances, ensuring that their 
voices are heard and addressed in a timely 
and appropriate manner.
We are 
currently in 
process of 
evaluating 
the pending 
complaints 
and 
appropriate 
actions shall 
be taken 
on resolution.
