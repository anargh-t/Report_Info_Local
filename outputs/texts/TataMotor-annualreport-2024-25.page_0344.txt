13   Inventories
(A)  Accounting policy
Inventories  (other  than  those  recognised  consequent  to  the  sale  of  vehicles  subject  to  repurchase  arrangements) 
are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost of raw materials, components and consumables are 
ascertained on a first in first out basis. Cost, including fixed and variable production overheads, are allocated to work-
in-progress and finished goods determined on a full absorption cost basis. Cost of inventories also include all other 
costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value is the estimated 
selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated cost of completion and selling expenses. Inventories 
include vehicles sold subject to repurchase arrangements. These vehicles are carried at cost to the Company and are 
amortised in changes in inventories of finished goods to their residual values (i.e., estimated second hand sale value) 
over the term of the arrangement.
(B)  Inventories consist of the following:-
(a)
Raw materials and components
(b) Work-in-progress
(c)
(d)
(e)
(f)
Finished goods
