34  Revenue from operations
(A)  Accounting policy
The Company generates revenue principally from –
a) 
Sale  of  products  –  (i)  commercial  and  passenger  vehicles  and  vehicle  parts  and  (ii)  Sales  of  other  products  - 
certain software products and other automotive products.
The Company recognises revenues from sale of products measured at the amount of transaction price (net of 
variable consideration), when it satisfies its performance obligation at a point in time which is when products 
are delivered to dealers or when delivered to a carrier for export sales, which is when control including risks 
and rewards and title of ownership pass to the customer, collectability of the resulting receivables is reasonably 
assured and when there are no longer any unfulfilled obligation. The transaction price of goods sold is net of 
variable  consideration  on  account  of  various  discounts  and  schemes  offered  by  the  Company  as  part  of  the 
contract. The Company operates predominantly on cash and carry basis.
The  Company  offers  sales  incentives  in  the  form  of  variable  marketing  expense  to  customers,  which  vary 
depending on the timing and customer of any subsequent sale of the vehicle. This sales incentive is accounted for 
as a revenue reduction and is constrained to a level that is highly probable not to reverse the amount of revenue
