Risk
Upstream (Medium term): 
Relying on suppliers that 
require large volumes of 
water for their operations 
makes TML vulnerable to 
disruptions, especially if 
those suppliers are located 
in regions prone to water 
scarcity or drought.
Own Operations (Medium 
term): Inadequate wages 
and gender pay inequity 
can decrease employee 
satisfaction, increase 
turnover, reduce diversity 
and may lead to labor 
disputes. Implementing 
proactive labor practices 
can attract potential 
employees, boost morale, 
and enhance innovation 
and productivity. 
Own Operations (Medium 
term): Neglecting 
investment in skills 
development could lead to 
a workforce unable to keep 
pace with technological 
progress. Cultivating a 
skilled and diverse team 
can spur innovation, 
enabling the Company to 
produce state-of-the-art 
products and sustain its 
competitive advantage. 
Own Operations (Medium 
term): Failure to comply 
with evolving health and 
safety regulations can 
result in fines, sanctions, 
and legal actions. These 
penalties can be costly and 
can impact a company’s 
financial health.
