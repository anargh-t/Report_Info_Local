adapt or mitigate
TML is conducting a 
climate risk assessment 
of its top suppliers to 
ensure early detection and 
preparedness in the event 
of a climate change related 
disaster.
The Company has 
established systems to 
handle climate-related 
disasters, supported 
by a strong business 
continuity plan. TML is also 
performing a climate risk 
assessment of its plants to 
ensure early detection and 
preparedness.
TML is actively engaged in 
biodiversity conservation 
measures. The Company 
has launched a wetland 
project that includes 1,800 
wetlands across four 
states. This will enhance its 
environmental stewardship 
and align with global 
sustainability trends.
TML is working on 
exploring Nature-based 
solutions linked to the 
sale of products that 
can play a significant 
role in enhancing a 
Company’s environmental 
responsibility and 
aligning with consumer 
expectations for 
sustainability.
Own operations 
(Medium term): Extreme 
weather conditions 
can significantly impact 
manufacturing facilities, 
causing disruptions that 
stall production and 
business operations. These 
interruptions can result in 
revenue loss and increased 
operational costs.
Upstream (Medium 
term): Climate change 
may lead to shortages of 
essential raw materials for 
automotive components, 
affecting their availability 
and cost. Suppliers in 
climate-vulnerable areas 
face operational risks 
that threaten supply 
chain reliability and 
TML’s efficiency. These 
disruptions can halt 
production, impacting 
operations and causing 
economic losses.
Own Operations (Long 
term): TML has a 
significant opportunity to 
incorporate Nature-Based 
Solutions (‘NBS’) into its 
strategies to mitigate 
the impact of climate 
change on biodiversity. 
These solutions can help 
the company address 
environmental challenges 
while enhancing its 
sustainability credentials. 
Upstream (Long term): 
Upstream biodiversity 
and ecosystem risks 
stem from raw material 
sourcing linked to 
deforestation, habitat loss, 
and land degradation. 
These impacts may pose 
regulatory, reputational, 
and operational risks, 
emphasizing the need for 
sustainable sourcing and 
supplier due diligence.
Financial implications of 
the risk or opportunity 
(Indicate positive or 
negative implications)
Negative Implications: 
This risk is anticipated to 
negatively impact TML’s 
revenue due to production 
disruptions caused by 
supply chain issues. 
Additionally, developing 
alternative sources will 
further affect TML’s 
finances.
This risk is expected to 
negatively impact TML’s 
revenue due to production 
stoppages resulting from 
facility damage caused by 
extreme climatic events.
Negative Implications: This 
risk may have a negative 
impact on TML finances. 
Upstream biodiversity and 
ecosystem losses from 
raw material sourcing 
linked to deforestation, 
habitat loss, and land 
degradation may pose 
regulatory, reputational, 
and operational risks.
Positive implications:  
Developing products and 
services that incorporate 
NBS principles can attract 
environmentally conscious 
consumers. This can open 
new market opportunities 
and increase sales, 
particularly as demand 
for sustainable solutions 
grows. 
Working with suppliers to 
reduce the biodiversity 
impacts can help attract 
environmentally conscious 
consumers and make the 
supply chain more resilient.
