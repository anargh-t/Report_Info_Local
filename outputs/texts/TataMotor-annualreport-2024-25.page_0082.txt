Planet
To promote planet 
resilience, our efforts focus 
on three interconnected 
pillars of action that 
resonate with the 
Tata Group’s vision of 
environmental stewardship, 
as encapsulated by 
Project Aalingana.
“I believe that the social 
responsibility of our industrial 
enterprises should now extend, 
even beyond serving people, to 
the environment. This need is now 
fairly well recognised but there is 
still considerable scope for most 
industrial ventures to extend their 
support not only to human beings 
but also to the land, to the forests, 
to the waters and to the creatures 
that inhabit them.”

Aalingana — meaning ‘embrace’ in Sanskrit, embodies the Tata Group’s vision of 
a greener, cleaner, sustainable, and equitable future for our planet.
Our goal of achieving net zero by 2045 and our mission to secure the future

into our business strategy. This commitment is centred around three

and biodiversity.
