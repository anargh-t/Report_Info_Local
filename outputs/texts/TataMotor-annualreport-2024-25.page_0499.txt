(iv)   Derivative financial instruments and risk management
The Company has entered into a variety of foreign currency, interest rates and commodity forward contracts 
and  options  to  manage  its  exposure  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates,  interest  rates  and  commodity 
price risk. The counterparty is generally a bank. These financial exposures are managed in accordance with the 
Company’s risk management policies and procedures.
The Company also enters into interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swap agreements, mainly to 
manage exposure on its fixed rate or variable rate debt. The Company uses interest rate derivatives or currency 
swaps  to  hedge  exposure  to  exchange  rate  fluctuations  on  principal  and  interest  payments  for  borrowings 
denominated in foreign currencies. In all cases the Company uses a hedge ratio of 1:1.
Specific transactional risks include risks like liquidity and pricing risks, interest rate and exchange rate fluctuation 
risks, volatility risks, counterparty risks, settlement risks and gearing risks.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments are determined using valuation techniques based on information 
derived from observable market data.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is as follows:

instead measured at fair value through profit or loss.
