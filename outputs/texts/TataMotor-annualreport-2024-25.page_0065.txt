As a leader in India’s EV landscape, 
our commitment to innovation is 
anchored in building future‑ready 
EVs that redefine performance, 
safety, and user experience. Central 
to this has been our ground‑up, pure 
EV architecture – Acti.ev – which 
underpins vehicles like the Curvv.ev. 
Leveraging the Acti.ev architecture, 
we have been able to deliver a 500 km+ 
range, faster charging speeds at 1.2C, 
stronger performance, and greater 
space efficiency through features like 
the frunk. We have also pioneered 
industry‑first features such as Acoustic 
Vehicle Alerting System (AVAS) and 
integrated charging aggregator apps, 
which help enhance the EV ownership 
experience. Collectively, our innovation 
in EVs has been a bold step forward 
in our vision of delivering innovative, 
desirable, and sustainable mobility 
solutions to Indian customers. 
Collaboration with world‑class 
academic institutions is key to JLR’s 
Reimagine strategy.
In FY25, the Company launched its 
new Supply Chain Innovation Hub 
in partnership with the Warwick 
Manufacturing Group (WMG). 
Located within the state‑of‑the‑art 
facility at the National Automotive 
Innovation Centre (NAIC) in Warwick, 
the Hub serves as a ‘Living Lab’ test 
environment to prove innovative AI 
and data‑driven supply chain solutions 
to enhance resilience and sustainability 
in an ever‑increasing complex world.
By combining JLR’s expertise with 
WMG’s groundbreaking research 
teams, they aim to push boundaries 
and set new standards in the 
automotive industry.
To accelerate JLR’s prowess in the areas 
of Electrification, Connectivity, Digital 
Services, Metaverse, Industry 4.0, 
Talent and Sustainability, the Company 
has built an evolving network of 
interdependent technology hubs.
This financial year, the Company set 
up its new Open Innovation Hub in 
Bangalore, India, to deliver deep 
tech innovations to support JLR’s 
Reimagine strategy.
The hub, located near JLR’s local 
engineering teams, will connect 
India’s bright startup ecosystem with 
JLR’s global engineering workforce to 
find new technological, engineering 
and sustainability solutions for 
the Company.
Working with its corporate innovation 
partner, Plug and Play, as well as, 
academia, industry and government, 
the hub will develop industry‑leading 
solutions, such as advancements in 
ADAS and electric vehicle charging.
