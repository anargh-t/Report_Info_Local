TML has joined the 
corporate engagement 
program of Science-Based 
Targets for Nature which 
is created by the Science 
Based Targets Network, 
or “SBTN”. The Network 
is developing Science-
Based Targets for Nature 
for companies to address 
their environmental 
impacts across terrestrial, 
freshwater, and marine 
realms, in addition to 
climate.  This structured 
approach will help 
Tata Motors reduce 
its contribution to key 
drivers of nature loss. In 
FY25, we have identified 
material impacts of our 
operations and those of 
our immediate upstream 
value chain on nature and 
biodiversity.
The Company engages 
regularly with regulators 
and the government to 
shape the agenda on air 
pollution. TML has invested 
significantly in R&D to 
reduce air emissions from 
its products and in its own 
operations.
All TML Plants ensure 
optimal water consumption 
through leakage 
prevention, water efficient 
technologies, rain water 
harvesting, and closed 
loop re-cycling. Most TML 
locations operate as zero 
liquid discharge facilities, 
and there are ongoing 
plans to expand this 
approach to more sites..
Negative Implications: 
Tighter regulations related 
to air pollution are likely 
to necessitate R&D and 
upgrades to manufacturing 
facilities. Also, there 
needs to be strategic shift 
towards cleaner product 
portfolio like Electric 
vehicles with zero tailpipe 
emissions. This will require 
significant investments.
Negative Implications: 
This risk may have negative 
impact on TML finances. 
Supply chain disruption 
gives rise to production 
delays, impacting revenue. 
Water risks threaten 
Tata Motors Limited’s 
business continuity, 
especially in water-scarce 
areas, potentially causing 
operational disruptions 
and financial losses. 
Investing in efficient water 
management is essential 
to ensure resilience and 
protect profitability

Risk
Own operations (Medium 
term): Stricter pollution 
controls and regulations 
may necessitate costly R&D 
investments and upgrades 
to manufacturing facilities 
and cleaner product 
portfolio.
Downstream (Medium 
term):  Air pollution from 
internal combustion engine 
(ICE) vehicles contributes 
to environmental 
degradation.
Own operations: High 
consumption and 
withdrawal requirements, 
particularly in water-
stressed regions poses 
a significant risk. These 
risks may impact 
operational continuity, 
regulatory compliance, 
and community relations, 
making efficient water 
management and 
conservation critical to 
long-term sustainability.
