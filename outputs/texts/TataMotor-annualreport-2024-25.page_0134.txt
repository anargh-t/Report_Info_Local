Supply chain and product 
emissions scope 3
Our Scope 3 emissions are dominated 
by in‑use emissions. These are the 
emissions generated from the use of 
our vehicles. The electrification of our 
fleet is, therefore, essential to achieve 
our science‑based targets and net zero 
ambition. Central to this is our aim 
for all brands to offer a pure‑electric 
option by 2030.
However, the achievement of these 
ambitions is highly dependent on 
consumer demand for battery electric 
vehicles. We must also ensure that 
we do not ‘burden shift’ by moving 
emissions into our supply chain as 
we make this transition. Therefore, 
to decarbonise our supply chain and 
product in‑use emissions to net zero, 
we must:
•  Electrify our products to reduce 
direct product emissions to zero
•  Work with our value chain to 
decarbonise the supply of key 
materials and increased use of 
recycled‑content materials
Key initiatives
Our reduction in use of sold product 
emissions totalled 1.29 tCO2e/vehicle 
in the last financial year, driven 
primarily by growth in plug‑in hybrid 
electric (PHEV) and battery electric 
(BEV) as a proportion of total vehicles 
retailed in FY25.
Our Procurement and Engineering 
teams continued to collaborate with 
suppliers to commit to the use of 
recycled and low‑impact materials, as 
well as to enhance the accuracy of our 
Scope 3 purchased goods reporting 
in FY25, with particular focus on steel 
and aluminium supply chains. This 
process resulted in a total reduction of 
0.62 tCO2e/vehicle from our Scope 3 
purchased goods and services. These 
improvements included lower product 
carbon footprints (PCFs) reported by 
suppliers, such as for windshields and 
the contracting of recycled content in 
sheet metal and components such as 
axles and compressor housings.
Performance
Scope 1 and 2 emissions
In FY25, our absolute Scope 1 and 
2 emissions marginally increased to 
249.5 ktCO2e. This was a 1% increase 
compared to our location‑based 
FY20 baseline but a 23.4% reduction 
compared to our FY20 baseline. This 
was also 3% ahead of the required 
SBTi trajectory to be aligned to a 
1.5°C pathway.
Scope 3
FY25 delivered continued improvement 
in the impact of new vehicles during 
their use, as well as collaboration with 
our supply chain to reduce the impact 
of the parts and components we use. 
Our Scope 3 ‘use of sold products’ 
emissions for FY25 were 238.75 gCO2e 
per vehicle km, representing a 
reduction of 6.7% compared to our 
FY20 baseline and a 3.1% improvement 
compared to FY24.
Our Scope 3 ‘combined use of sold 
products and purchased goods and 
services’ emissions for FY25 were 
60.51 tCO2e/vehicle. This was a 
5.9% reduction compared to our 
FY20 baseline and a 2.8% reduction 
compared to our FY24 performance.
This means that in terms of absolute 
emissions, our Scope 3 emissions 
across these categories totalled 
25.9 MtCO2e — a 20.7% reduction 
compared to the FY20 baseline and 
a 3.4% improvement over FY24. This 
improvement was driven by lower 
emissions and reduced production 
volumes lower per vehicle emissions 
relative to the baseline year.
