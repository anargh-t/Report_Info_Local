1   Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI)
Tata Motors remains steadfast in 
promoting equal opportunities 
within the organisation and beyond. 
Building upon our long‑standing 
legacy through our programmes and 
inclusive practices, we strive to create 
a workplace culture where every 
individual feels valued, respected, 
and empowered to unlock their 
true potential. 
Tata Motors follows an ‘Equal 
Opportunity Employer Policy’ and 
launched a formal DEI programme 
called DEIsha (Direction) in FY24. 
Under this, TML has several policies 
and programmes in place that ensure 
flexibility, parent‑friendliness, work‑
life balance while also taking care of 
healthcare needs and the special needs 
of new mothers and opportunities 
for women interested in returning to 
the workplace after career breaks. 
Our future‑focused perspective is 
reflected in the benefits we offer to 
our employees’ partners, and not just 
their spouses.

DEIsha architecture  
and governance 
To ensure DEI is strategised, owned and 
implemented by all stakeholders, we have 
established a strong governance structure 
to ensure accountability, transparency, and 
alignment with organisational vision through 
DEIsha. It helps drive meaningful change, 
monitor progress, and address systemic 
inequities effectively.
