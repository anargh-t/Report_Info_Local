Dear Shareholders,
I hope this letter finds you and your 
families in good health.
FY25 was a year of mixed trends for the 
Indian Commercial Vehicle industry, 
shaped by macroeconomic caution and 
evolving market dynamics. The industry 
recorded a marginal decline of ~1%, 
primarily due to pressures in the HCV 
and SCV segments, especially in Q2. 
While cautious sentiment ahead of 
state and general elections led to a 
moderation in demand, segments like 
buses remained resilient — driven by 
public transport investments and the 
shift to electric mobility. Encouragingly, 
electric CVs gained traction, 
especially in buses and last‑mile 
applications, supported by improving 
TCO economics. Across the board, 
infrastructure investments, cleaner fuel 
adoption, and digitalisation continued 
to shape fleet and OEM strategies.

deliver an improved performance 
with disciplined cost management, 
improved realisation, and the growing 
contribution of our Parts, Service 
and other Downstream businesses. 
Despite marginal declines in sales 
volumes, our EBIT reached an all‑time 
high of I6,794 crore — representing 
a 4.9% growth over FY24. The business 
outperformed the industry, gaining 
share and improving realisation in 
Trucks and Buses.
With the restructuring into eight 
focused business verticals now fully 
embedded, our transformation into 
a future‑ready, customer‑centric 
organisation is enhancing our agility, 
strengthening accountability, and 
aligning us more closely with both our 
strategic priorities and the evolving 
needs of our customers.

financiers, fleet owners, logistics 
providers, and — importantly —

physical network and digital platforms 
such as Fleet Edge, we deliver 
integrated, tech‑enabled solutions to

The adoption of smart telematics 
across ~8,00,000 vehicles is 
enabling data‑driven decisions that 
improve uptime, reduce operating 
costs, and enhance driver safety. 
Our Customer Success Centres (CSCs) 
are helping fleet operators maximise 
performance and minimise downtime. 
Our comprehensive engagement also
