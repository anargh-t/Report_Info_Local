Capitalisation of product engineering costs as reported by the component auditor of Jaguar Land Rover Automotive PLC  
(hereinafter referred to as JLR Group)
See Note 6 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
Accounting Treatment
The  JLR  Group  has  historically  capitalised  a  significant 
portion of its product development costs. A key judgment is 
involved in determining whether these costs meet the criteria 
for capitalisation.
the 
technical 
include  confirming 
These 
feasibility  of 
developing  the  asset  for  use  or  for  sale  and  ensuring  that 
the costs capitalised are directly attributable. There is a risk 
that  the  JLR  Group  may  capitalise  costs  that  do  not  meet 
this criteria.
In  addition,  it  is  noted  that  there  is  a  risk  of  fraud  around 
the  allocation  of  directly  attributable  expenditure  to  the 
correct  project  codes  to  ensure  appropriate  costs  are 
being capitalised.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The audit procedures applied by the auditor of the component 
(JLR Group) included:
-  
-  
-  
-  
 Control operation: Tested controls including in relation 
to  the  Directors’  assessment  as  to  whether  product 
engineering costs are eligible for capitalisation;
Personnel  interviews:  Corroborated  judgements  made 
by the Directors around the continuation of capitalisation 
of  product  engineering  costs  through  discussions  with 
project level staff;
Component  auditor’s  sector  experience:  Critically 
assessed  the  Directors’  judgements  regarding  product 
engineering  costs  identified  by  the  Directors  as  being 
eligible  for  capitalisation  against  both  the  accounting 
standards and our experience of practical application of 
these standards in other companies;
Tests  of  details:  For  a  sample  of  product  engineering 
costs  identified  by  the  Directors  as  being  eligible  for 
capitalisation,  agreed  that  their  nature  was  consistent 
with  the  description  of  the  account  to  which  those 
costs  were  recorded,  and  the  timing  of  recognition 
was  appropriate.  In  addition,  the  component  auditor 
inspected any reallocations from accounts ineligible for 
capitalisation to accounts that are eligible as capitalised 
project engineering costs, which the component auditor 
would consider to meet the criteria of a high risk journal, 
and obtained evidence to assess the appropriateness of 
the reallocation; and
- 
Assessing transparency: Assessed the adequacy of the 
Group’s  disclosures  in  respect  of  the  key  judgements 
made relating to the nature of the costs capitalised.
Valuation of defined benefit plan obligations as reported by the component auditor of JLR Group
See Note 36 to consolidated financial statements
The key audit matter
Subjective valuation
Small  changes  in  the  assumptions  applied  in  the  valuation 
of  the  liabilities,  being  the  discount  rate,  inflation  rate  and 
mortality/life  expectancy  used  to  value  the  JLR  Group’s 
pension  obligation  (before  deducting  scheme  assets)  would 
have a significant effect on the JLR Group’s net pension surplus.
The  effect  of  these  matters  is  that,  as  part  of  our  risk 
assessment,  we  determined  that  the  JLR  Group’s  pension 
obligation  has  a  high  degree  of  estimation  uncertainty, 
with a potential range of reasonable outcomes greater than 
our  materiality  for  the  financial  statements  as  a  whole,  and 
possibly many times that amount.
How the matter was addressed in our audit
The audit procedures applied by the auditor of the component 
(JLR Group) included:
-  
-  
Control  operation:  Tested  controls  operating  over  the 
assumptions applied in the valuation and inspected the 
JLR Group’s annual evaluation of the assumptions used 
by  its  actuarial  expert.  Tested  the  JLR  Group’s  controls 
operating over selection and monitoring of its actuarial 
expert for competence and objectivity;
Benchmarking  assumptions:  Challenged,  with  the 
support  of  their  own  actuarial  specialists,  the  key 
assumptions  applied,  being  the  discount  rate,  inflation 
rate  and  mortality/life  expectancy 
to  externally 
derived data;
