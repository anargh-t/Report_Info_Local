Is there a mechanism available to receive and redress grievances for the following categories of employees and workers?

Permanent Workers
Yes/No, (if Yes, then give details of the mechanism in brief)
Yes. Tata Motors has a three-stage dedicated grievance redressal forum operating at various levels. These 
forums—Joint Shop Council (JSC), Joint Divisional Council (JDC), and Joint Management Council (JMC)—
are  strategically  located  at  the  Shop,  Division,  and  Plant  levels,  respectively.  They  serve  as  platforms 
where workmen can voice their grievances, ensuring that their concerns are heard and addressed in a 
timely and appropriate manner. The closure of grievances is also monitored at the Plant level.
Furthermore,  for  contract  labour,  we  have  Business  Partner  Forums  to  address  their  grievances.  In 
addition,  we  provide  helpline  numbers  and  grievance  drop  boxes  as  alternate  mechanisms  to  ensure 
accessibility and inclusivity in grievance redressal.

Workers
The Company has adopted the Tata Code of Conduct (TCoC), which outlines our commitment to ethical 
conduct.  All  internal  and  external  stakeholders  of  the  Tata  Group  are  expected  to  operate  within  the 
framework  of  this  Code.  Training  and  awareness  programs  on  the  TCoC  are  conducted  regularly  for 
employees and relevant stakeholders.
We  also  have  dedicated  Human  Rights  and  Whistleblower  Policies.  The  Company  has  established  a 
robust  governance  mechanism  to  ensure  confidentiality  and  protect  whistleblowers  from  harassment 
or  victimization,  including  retaliation,  threats,  termination/suspension  of  service,  disciplinary  action, 
transfer, demotion, denial of promotion, or any other form of intimidation. This protection also extends 
to prevent any direct or indirect misuse of authority to obstruct a whistleblower’s right to perform their 
duties or to make further protected disclosures.
Permanent Employees
The  Company  has  a  well-defined  process  to  address  concerns  through  the  Ethics  Committee,  which 
oversees due investigations.
Other than Permanent 
Employees
Oversight  of  the  TCoC,  Whistleblower  Policy,  and  Human  Rights  Policy  lies  with  the  Chairperson  of 
the Audit Committee and the Chief Ethics Counsellor. An ethics helpline is available for employees to 
anonymously report any ethical violations. This helpline can be accessed in the following ways:
1. 
2. 
 A whistleblower can report concerns via the toll-free number: 000 800 0502 221, or through the 
web portal: tatamotors.ethicspoint.com. Concerns can be submitted in multiple languages.
 Alternatively, concerns can be submitted in writing to the Chief Ethics Counsellor or the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee.
In  line  with  our  commitment  to  gender  inclusion  and  diversity,  and  to  create  a  safe,  fair,  and  just 
workplace,  the  Company  has  implemented  a  Prevention  of  Sexual  Harassment  at  Workplace  (POSH) 
Policy.  The  POSH  framework  includes  several  Internal  Committees  (ICs),  along  with  an  APEX  Internal 
Committee that acts as an appellate body and oversees dissemination of this policy.
We have developed standard guidelines to address sexual harassment, which are enforced by location 
or subunit-specific committees at the Plant and Regional levels. This policy covers all women associates 
(including permanent, temporary, contractual, and trainees), women service providers, and any woman 
visiting  the  Company’s  workplace.  Any  form  of  objectionable  conduct  is  subject  to  strict  disciplinary 
action.
