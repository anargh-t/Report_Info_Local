In 2018, Tata Motors launched an agro‑forestry 
plantation model, promoting sustainable 
livelihoods in one block in Palghar Distrcit of 
Maharashtra. Emerging from a participatory 
model, the Wadi project aims to ensure that 
high‑yielding fruit and forestry trees provide 
economic benefits for the rural and tribal 
communities for the next 5 to 10 years, 
thus providing them with food and income 
security and arresting migration. Till date, 
around 18,000 farmers have benefitted trough 
this project.
