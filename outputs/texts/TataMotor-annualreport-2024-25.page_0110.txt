A win-win cultural assimilation
A blend of best practices from 
both companies was adopted, with 
an emphasis on Ford’s strengths. 
The Sanand plant now operates under 
an ‘inverted pyramid’ structure, 
empowering staff and fostering 
a ‘Serve and Care’ environment. 
This shift from a command‑and‑control 
model has resulted in a leaner 
staff structure. 
People and culture
Drishti 2.0 for technicians
Tata Motors has developed Drishti 
2.0, a mobile app designed specifically 
for technicians. The app helps them 
with basic HR and admin tasks by 
giving them easy, on‑the‑go access 
to payslips, leave cards, and travel 
expense submissions. This streamlines 
processes and frees up valuable work 
time. The platform fosters continuous 
learning through bite‑sized video 
modules, enhancing skill development. 
Digital notice boards ensure clear 
communication across the shop floor. 
Drishti 2.0 reflects TML’s commitment 
to a dynamic and empowered work 
environment through technology.
People integration  
and growth
Following its successful acquisition and 
assimilation into Tata Motors, the new 
Sanand facility has now transitioned 
into full‑fledged production. 
This marks a significant milestone in 
our growth journey.
To enable a seamless integration and 
empower the workforce, multiple 
initiatives have been rolled out across 
key focus areas — Culture, Capability 
Building, Higher Education, Health 
& Well‑being, and Collaboration 
& Communication. These efforts are 
aimed at fostering a cohesive work 
environment, aligned with Tata Motors’ 
values, and building a future‑ready, 
engaged workforce.
