Wellness at Tata Motors
Employee well‑being remains a key pillar of our people strategy. Under our Health 
& Wellness initiatives, we have adopted a comprehensive, prevention‑focused 
approach to promote long‑term physical and mental health.
•  Through primordial prevention measures such as digital wellness programmes, 
cardiac Q risk assessments, wellness coaching, and canteen menu 
transformation, we are building a foundation for healthier lifestyles. 
•  Primary prevention initiatives — including tobacco cessation, weight 
management, and pre‑diabetes detection — aim to address health risks early. 
•  The secondary prevention efforts like stress testing and chronic disease control 
help in effective monitoring and timely intervention.
These layered, holistic strategies have contributed to a marked improvement in 
the overall health and well‑being of our employees, reinforcing our commitment to 
thriving, future‑ready and future‑fit workforce.
