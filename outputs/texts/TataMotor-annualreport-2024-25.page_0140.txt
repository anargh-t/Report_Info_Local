Responsible
business
The responsible business 
pillar is a cornerstone of 
our sustainability strategy, 
aiming to ensure we 
conduct business ethically 
and with integrity. Being 
a responsible business 
provides the foundations 
for our work in Planet 
Regenerate and Engage 
for Good when it comes to 
environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) topics.

Focus areas
Monitoring and responding to  
ESG legislation and regulation
Developing the right strategies and governance 
processes to deliver our ESG commitments
Embedding environmental and social risks into our 
enterprise risk management process
Transparently disclosing and  
reporting our progress and performance
Legislation and regulation
The landscape of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) regulation is rapidly 
changing. We are working to ensure our disclosures align with relevant Climate 
Financial Disclosures while also preparing for upcoming legislation such as the 
EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and the EU Deforestation 
Regulation (EUDR). This involves scanning for new and emerging legislation, 
interpreting and implementing necessary changes into the business and then 
monitoring and disclosing progress on an ongoing basis.
Strategy and governance
Our stakeholders have high expectations regarding our sustainability efforts. 
This year the value of sustainability was recognised at the highest level within 
the business with the appointment of Andrea Debbane to the position of Chief 
Sustainability Officer (CSO). We have also established a senior‑level, cross‑
functional Sustainability Steering Group to ensure the work we are doing in relation 
to sustainability supports and complements our Reimagine strategy.
