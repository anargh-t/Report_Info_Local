Business performance overview 
FY25 proved the strength of our Reimagine strategy as the 
Company withstood headwinds to deliver profit before tax 
of £2.5 billion versus £2.2 billion in the prior year, and achieve 
our financial goals of an 8.5% adjusted EBIT margin and a 
positive net cash position. We continued to transform our 
facilities for electrification; unveiled the reimagined Jaguar 
brand; concluded the final stages of Range Rover Electric 
testing; and established the JLR Foundation to empower 
children and young people to reach their potential.

Our priority is to ensure we 
deliver for our global clients 
and protect EBIT through the 
delivery of transformation 
and efficiency initiatives. 
Looking ahead, we expect 
investment spending to 
remain at £18 billion over 
a five-year period and will 
be funded by operational 
cash flows. We continue 
to evaluate the impact of 
global challenges.
