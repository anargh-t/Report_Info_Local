(c)   Financial risk management :
In  the  course  of  its  business,  the  Company  is  exposed  primarily  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currency  exchange 
rates,  interest  rates,  equity  prices,  liquidity  and  credit  risk,  which  may  adversely  impact  the  fair  value  of  its 
financial instruments.
The Company has a risk management policy which not only covers the foreign exchange risks but also other risks 
associated with the financial assets and liabilities such as interest rate risks and credit risks. The risk management 
policy is approved by the board of directors. The risk management framework aims to:
• 
• 
 Create  a  stable  business  planning  environment  by  reducing  the  impact  of  currency  and  interest  rate 
fluctuations on the Company’s business plan.
 Achieve  greater  predictability  to  earnings  by  determining  the  financial  value  of  the  expected  earnings 
in advance.
(i)   Market risk
Market risk is the risk of any loss in future earnings, in realisable fair values or in future cash flows that may 
result from a change in the price of a financial instrument. The value of a financial instrument may change 
as  a  result  of  changes  in  the  interest  rates,  foreign  currency  exchange  rates,  equity  price  fluctuations, 
liquidity and other market changes. Future specific market movements cannot be normally predicted with 
reasonable accuracy.
(a)  Foreign currency exchange rate risk:
 The fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may have potential impact on the income statement, 
statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, statement of changes in  equity and statement 
of cash flows where any transaction references more than one currency or where assets/liabilities are 
denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.
 Considering the countries and economic environment in which the Company operates, its operations 
are subject to risks arising from fluctuations in exchange rates in those countries. The risks primarily 
relate  to  fluctuations  in  U.S.  dollar,  Euro  and  GBP  against  the  respective  functional  currencies  of 
the Company.
 The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange and other derivative instruments 
primarily  to  hedge  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate  exposure.  Any  weakening  of  the  functional 
currency may impact the Company’s cost of exports and cost of borrowings and consequently may 
increase the cost of financing the Company’s capital expenditures.
