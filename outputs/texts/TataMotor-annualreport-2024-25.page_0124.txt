Alligned with the ‘National Education Policy’ 2020, the Company 
partnered with Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) to establish 
25 ‘Automotive Skill Labs’ at Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas 
(JNVs) to provide secondary and senior secondary students 
with essential subject knowledge, hands‑on skills, and valuable 
industry exposure — all within the school premises.
Post‑schooling, the students were provided an opportunity to 
enrol for a Diploma in Manufacturing Technology, including 
a full stipend and on‑the‑job training at Tata Motors’ 
manufacturing facilities. Those interested in continuing with 
Tata Motors can pursue a BTech in engineering — a 3.5‑year 
executive education programme in collaboration with select 
engineering institutes — leading to permanent employment 
after five years.
