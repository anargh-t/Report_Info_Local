Strategic and

Leveraging localisation 
as a differentiator
Localisation remains a key 
differentiator in our strategy, with 
75–80% localisation at Tier 1 level. 
This high degree of localisation 
provides significant agility, cost 
advantages, and enhanced supply 
chain resilience. Beyond operational 
benefits, it also contributes 
meaningfully to the long‑term growth 
of India’s EV ecosystem. Our strong 
localisation efforts have further 
enabled us to qualify for and secure 
benefits under the Government of 
India’s Production Linked Incentive 
(PLI) scheme, which we will use to 
fund our future investments into 
sustainable mobility.
Ensuring India’s widest and
most proven EV portfolio
 Our core strength is having India’s 
widest and most accessible EV 
portfolio, spanning multiple body 
styles and price points — from I8 lakh 
to I22 lakh. Our tried‑and‑tested EVs 
have collectively clocked over 5 billion 
kilometres on Indian roads, and are 
catering to a broad range of customer 
needs and use cases. With the addition 
of the Curvv.ev this year and future‑
ready models like the Sierra, Harrier, 
and AVINYA announced, our EVs 
continue to set benchmarks in safety, 
technology, features, and design.
In addition, our extensive EV network 
has enabled us to attract a diverse 
range of customers across multiple 
geographies and has been a core pillar 
of our EV leadership.

Building a robust EV 
Charging Ecosystem through 
collaboration
 We are actively shaping a strong and 
accessible EV ecosystem through open 
collaboration with key stakeholders, 
driving rapid charging infrastructure 
growth across key hotspots 
nationwide. This year, to enhance the 
customer experience, we introduced 
a unified charging aggregator app 
that simplifies access to public 
charging, and mitigates the need to 
have multiple apps. In the next phase 
of Open Collaboration for Charging, 
we announced a comprehensive 
suite of services for EV customers 
to enhance ownership experience 
including Tata.ev Verified chargers and 
announced our commitment to deploy 
500 Tata.ev Mega chargers to support 
the segment’s next wave of growth.
Tata.ev Verified Chargers offer 
customers enhanced peace of mind 
during highway travel by ensuring 
reliability and accessibility, while 
the ongoing rollout of Tata.ev Mega 
chargers strengthens long‑distance EV 
ecosystem with faster, high‑capacity 
charging solutions.
