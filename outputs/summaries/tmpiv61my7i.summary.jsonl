GPT-4V and Google's Gemini are prime examples. • Smaller, Specialized Models: While giants like GPT-4 are powerful, they are expensive and unwieldy for many specific tasks. This is democratizing AI, enabling domain experts in marketing, finance, or HR to create solutions without needing a PhD in data science. • AI in Science and Engineering: AI is accelerating discovery in fields like drug discovery (predicting protein structures with AlphaFold), material science (designing new alloys or batteries), and climate modeling. The Era of Generative AI: Beyond the Hype This is the dominant trend, largely driven by the public release of models like ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Midjourney. The focus is now shifting from pure novelty to practical application and refinement. • Multimodality is King: The newest models don't just handle text or images in isolation. They can seamlessly understand and generate combinations of text, images, audio, and video. For example, you can show a model a picture and ask it a question about it, or generate a video from a text description. The trend is now towards creating smaller, more efficient \"fine-tuned\" models that excel at a particular job (e.g., legal document review, medical diagnosis assistance) at a fraction of the cost."}
